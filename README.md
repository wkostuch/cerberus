This repository is a consolidation of some of the work I did on legal text classification for my summer research at The University of North Texas. 

The various Python files in this repository were written by me, though the CSV data files were generated both by myself and other REU students.  Thank you to Tiffany, Sanjeev, Vincent, and Max for the sentence annotation work and for being good research partners over the summer.
