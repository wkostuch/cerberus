"The Government further asserts that ""these are not necessarily the exclusive public interests which the statute was enacted to protect..."", but rather, ""... it is possible that the Legislature formulated additional reasons for enacting the statute,"" (emphasis ours.)",2,Issue
"It is next contended that the court erred in permitting the state to bring out and prove on cross-examination of appellant the details of two prior offenses committed by him, by showing that in connection with a narcotics conviction in federal court in 1953, he received punishment of a $100 fine and in the 1959 narcotics conviction in state court alleged for enhancement, he received the minimum punishment of two years, of which he was required to serve only fourteen months.",2,Issue
It is next contended that the proof merely shows an extension of credit by the injured party to the Lewter Feed Lots Company in the sale of the tires and tube to appellant and therefore does not constitute theft.,2,Issue

"Appellant’s last contention is that the court committed reversible error during the state’s examination of the prosecuting witness, J. W. Donnell, with reference to his ownership and possession of the 4,000-acre tract when, upon objection being made by appellant, the court stated: “Well, I believe it is general knowledge that he does have possession of it.”",2,Issue

"The testimony as to the general reputation for virtue and chastity of the prosecutrix, offered after appellant had testified that she did not resist but in effect consented, was properly admitted.",4,Analysis
The testimony of the state sufficiently shows that the appellant was guilty as charged.,4,Analysis
"The two prior convictions alleged in the instant case, not having been successfully used in the prior case against appellant, were available to enhance punishment herein.",4,Analysis
"Therefore, appellant is in no position to complain of the search because the same or similar testimony was admitted without objection.",4,Analysis
"There is no evidence in the instant case that any officer, either acting by himself or through the prosecuting witness, induced appellant to commit the offense for the purpose of prosecuting him.",4,Analysis
"There was but one issue in this case, consent or not by the prosecutrix, and any circumstance that could be shown tending to show that the prosecutrix was not a virgin would be admissible as bearing on the issue of her consent in a manner consistent with the appellants’ innocence.",4,Analysis
The surnames are not idem sonans and the state concedes that the variance is fatal.,4,Analysis
"Therefore, the deletion of reference to the Claims Act would have been meaningless unless, as plaintiff argues, it eliminated any need to resort to the procedures of the Claims Act when suit is filed against GMH.",4,Analysis
"The witness expressed his opinion that, on such occasion, appellant was intoxicated.",4,Analysis
"The statutes relating to the waiver of a jury in a non-capital felony case provide that it shall be necessary for the state to introduce evidence into the record showing the guilt of the defendant, and that in no event shall a person charged be convicted upon his plea of guilty without sufficient evidence to support the same.",4,Analysis
The presumption is that the legislature intended to achieve a consistent body of law.,4,Analysis
"The state’s position appears to be that the corpus delicti was proved sufficiently by the testimony showing that the 14 year old girl had had sexual intercourse with someone, and that this evidence aided by and together with appellant’s confession is sufficient to sustain the conviction.",4,Analysis
"The proof further shows that dolophine is one of the same chemical formula and substance as “amidone”, named in the statute.",4,Analysis
The overruling of the objection upon the ground “Conclusion and is repetition” was not error warranting reversal.,4,Analysis
The informal bills fail to reflect error.,4,Analysis
The indictment appears to be sufficient and the trial court did not err in overruling appellant’s motion to quash.,4,Analysis
The general trend of authority is against an interpretation of repeal by implication.,4,Analysis
The finding of the barbiturates and amphetamine in the cabin was a part of the search and of the res gestae and proof thereof was admissible.,4,Analysis
"The fact that he may have also had the intent, as the evidence clearly indicates, of forcing her to become a prostitute so that he might profit therefrom would in nowise preclude a prosecution for the first offense shown.",4,Analysis
The evidence was undisputed that appellant consented to the search.,4,Analysis
This contention rests on Sheriff Owen’s testimony before the jury that he told the appellant to tell the truth; that it would be better for him to tell the truth; and he explained to him that if he did not it would still be against him.,4,Analysis
"The evidence of appellant’s attempt to procure the prosecuting witness’s daughter was clearly admissible as a part of the res gestae of the transaction and to show appellant’s scheme and design in the transaction with her mother, the prosecuting witness.",4,Analysis
"Thus, protection of the morals of the public might have been an additional reason for enacting the statute.",4,Analysis
"While dolophine is not named in the statutory definition of a narcotic drug, the proof shows that it is a narcotic drug and regis-' tered under such trade name.",4,Analysis
Truly this section does not regulate with narrow specificity.,4,Analysis
"While we recognize the rule that judgments speak verity and all presumptions are indulged in to sustain the judgment, we feel that the judgment should contain some factual allegations to give support to these findings and conclusions of the trial court.",4,Analysis
"While use of the credit card in the transaction did constitute an extention of credit to the Lewter Feed Lots Company, no credit was extended by the injured party to the appellant and his companions.",4,Analysis
"While the motion to quash was not timely made, being filed and presented after selection of the jury and after appellant entered his plea of not guilty, we have considered the grounds urged by appellant and find the allegations of the information sufficient to charge an offense.",4,Analysis
"While the court’s comment was improper, under the record we do not deem it such a comment as was reasonbly calculated to prejudice the rights of appellant.",4,Analysis
"While proof of the details of prior offenses committed by an accused is not permissible, we do not consider the inquiry made of appellant with reference to the punishment assessed in the two prior convictions and the time he served in the penitentiary as constituting proof of the details of the offenses committed.",4,Analysis
"While neither the requested charge or the charge given by the court were complete and entirely proper charges under Art. 1223 V.A.P.C., the refusal of appellant’s requested charge does not present reversible error.",4,Analysis
"While it is true that the question of a mortgage was never discussed by the parties in open court, it seems very unlikely that any party would contemplate transferring over an interest in realty without an adequate security interest.",4,Analysis
"While it is true that the arresting officer was the only witness for the state, his testimony needed no corroboration.",4,Analysis
"The evidence did not raise the issue of the involuntary character of the confession, hence no charge thereon was required.",4,Analysis
"While an accused is allowed great latitude in his voir dire examination of prospective jurors to determine whether a preemptory challenge will be used, there is nothing in the record which shows that the question sought to be propounded to the jurors relative to their participation in athletics had any relevancy to the inquiry; hence no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court is shown.",4,Analysis
"Where no inconsistency strong enough to evoke a repeal exists, a repeal by implication will not be found.",4,Analysis
"When a judgment is devoid of definite and specific factual allegations, we must then turn to the record to look for facts sufficient to sustain the action of the trial court in entering the judgment.",4,Analysis
"We think it necessary for the judgment in a contempt case to be specific and definite and almost as certain in its terms as an information or an indictment, so that the relator will be fully apprised of his alleged act of misconduct.",4,Analysis
"We need not pass upon the constitutionality of this portion of the statute, as appellant’s conviction does not rest upon the provisions under attack but upon other portions of the act defining a narcotic drug.",4,Analysis
"We have, however, reviewed the bill and find that the first portion is a logical deduction from the record which is properly before us and the second is a legitimate plea for proper punishment and law enforcement in the community.",4,Analysis
We have searched this record with care and have been unable to find the evidence to support the conclusion expressed in the State’s brief that appellant was seen unloading the still pot.,4,Analysis
We have examined the informal bills of exception appearing in the statement of facts and find no reversible error therein.,4,Analysis
We have carefully reviewed the various informal bills and find no error.,4,Analysis
We find no statement,4,Analysis
"We do not disagree with the results reached by this court in either Toombs or Thurman, supra.",4,Analysis
We are unable to agree with appellant that the statement certified by the court as having been made by state’s counsel may be reasonably construed as a reference to his failure to testify.,4,Analysis
"We are unable to agree that the description of the narcotic drug by its trade name, “dolophine”, was insufficient to charge an offense under the statute and to apprise the appellant of the offense charged against him.",4,Analysis
"Under the record, the statement was not res gestae.",4,Analysis
Toombs also had a witness to corroborate his denial of intoxication.,4,Analysis
The efforts of an accused to induce a witness to testify falsely may be shown as indicating a consciousness of guilt.,4,Analysis
"The State’s proof shows that appellant, as an officer of the company, used the mohair in question for a purpose not authorized by Gee, the owner, in his consignment to the company and is sufficient to sustain appellant’s conviction under the statute for embezzlement of the mohair as charged in the indictment.",4,Analysis
"The court held that sufficient diligence had not been demonstrated, and we agree with such holding.",4,Analysis
"In making such proof, the entire letter was admissible, although it was not necessary to set out the letter in its entirety in the information.",4,Analysis
"In Bill No. 4, no certification is made that the argument set forth therein was not supported by the evidence, hence it cannot be appraised because no statement of facts accompanies the record.",4,Analysis
If this testimony presents error it was rendered harmless by the introduction of appellant’s written statement and the testimony of the accomplice that they took the calf out of the pasture.,4,Analysis
"However, the rule in this Court has been well established that the testimony of an accomplice witness together with the confession of the accused is sufficient to establish the corpus delicti.",4,Analysis
"However, here it seems clear that the trial court chose to ignore certain representations made in open court as to the terms of immediate payment upon the sale of the property in question.",4,Analysis
Failure to comply with the rules requiring the filing of briefs authorizes a dismissal of the appeal for the want of prosecution.,4,Analysis
"By such contention, appellant complains of the evidence admitted which showed that.he had attempted to procure the daughter, Glenda Wilhite, to engage in prostitution; that he was arrested on a charge of possession of barbiturates and was later arrested under a warrant in a peace bond proceeding.",4,Analysis
"Assuming that the objection was sufficient, the admission of the evidence showing that a pistol was found in the automobile is not ground for reversal, the record containing a stipulation that the pistol introduced in evidence was under the front seat and was loaded, and that it was removed from appellant’s car on the day in question; and appellant testified in regard to the two firearms he had in the car.",4,Analysis
"Assuming that Lewter Feed Lots, to which the credit card was issued, may have been obligated to pay the credit invoice, this would not alter the fact that appellant and his companions obtained the same by false pretext.",4,Analysis
"Appellant’s statement to the witness after his arrest which led to the finding of the murder weapon was admissible as an oral confession under the exception contained in Art. 727, Y.A.C.C.P., Bingham v.",4,Analysis
"In the absence of an irreconcilable conflict, or where two provisions of legislation are so clearly repugnant as to vital matters which they relate, courts should construe all acts harmoniously where such construction is reasonably possible.",4,Analysis
"Appellant’s oral statement to Officer Geffert that he had the narcotics in his cabin which led to the officers finding the narcotic paraphernalia therein was admissible as an oral confession under the exception contained in Art: 727, supra, which reads, “* * * or, unless in connection with said confession he makes statements of facts or circumstances that are found to be true,",4,Analysis
"Appellant’s arrest for possession of barbiturates was clearly a part of the res gestae of the transaction with the prosecuting witness, and admissible as such.",4,Analysis
"Although credit was extended to Lewter Feed Lots, the fact remains that appellant and his companions obtained the property from the injured party by reason of the false pretext and representations made to him.",4,Analysis
"Also, the normal presumption that a seller of realty will require a mortgage or security agreement, made it necessary for the trial court to include such a mortgage requirement in its order to compel settlement.",4,Analysis
"All of the evidence shows he was in a position to have heard the statement, and his actions showed that he did.",4,Analysis
"Additional moral justification may have been due to the complaints by numerous Japanese tourist that some of these signs contained offensive or shocking language.""",4,Analysis
"“Entrapment”, in its legal sense, carries with it the presumption that the officer or agent manufactures the offense and incites the accused to commit it, for the purpose of prosecution.",4,Analysis
A suit filed under the Claims Act is a very narrow and limited area for relief.,4,Analysis
"605, 183 S.W. 2d 177; Judge Hawkins, speaking for the Court, said, “It is well established as a general rule that upon the trial of one charged with crime it is not permissible to show that another jointly or separately indicted for the same offense has been convicted or acquitted.”",4,Analysis
"""It is generally believed that one of the reasons the statute was enacted was to regulate the many businesses on Guam which have signs entirely in a language other than English or Chamorro that were reported to be advertising pornographic materials for sale.",4,Analysis
The Court of notes that this statute applies to commercial as well as noncommercial speech.,4,Analysis
Appellant’s failure to object at the time the pistol was introduced in evidence waived any complaint of the search.,4,Analysis
"In the case at bar the state’s witness did express the opinion that appellant was intoxicated, and the appellant had no witness to corroborate his version of the transaction.",4,Analysis
Appellant’s punishment was enhanced under Art. 63 P.C. by two prior convictions for felonies less than capital.,4,Analysis
"In the normal course of business dealings, a mortgage or some similar security interest would be expected, and it is the opinion of this Court that granting a mortgage in favor of the defendants would do less violence to the intention of the parties, while at the same time protecting defendant's equitable interests in the property which it was conveying.",4,Analysis
"The Court fears, however, that this procedure would not necessarily solve defendant's problem.",4,Analysis
"In the Hancock case we held that parol evidence of prior possession by the person alleged to be in the actual care, control, and management of the land was sufficient to prove his ownership and right to possession in trespass-to-try-title, as provided in Sec.",4,Analysis
The conduct inquired about on cross-examination must be inconsistent with the trait of character to which the witness had attested.,4,Analysis
"The careful trial judge submitted the issue of self-defense and defense of another; the jury resolved what conflict there was in the evidence against appellant, and we find it sufficient to support the conviction.",4,Analysis
The burden was upon the state to prove that the letter was written and sent.,4,Analysis
"The appellant’s confession, coupled with evidence showing the commission of the crime, is sufficient.",4,Analysis
"The allegation in the information that appellant did “send and cause to be sent” the anonymous letter was in the language of the statute, Art. 1295, supra, and sufficient to allege the manner and means by which the offense was committed.",4,Analysis
Testimony read into the record is tantamount to the introduction in evidence of the documents from which the testimony was taken.,4,Analysis
"Such an instrument has not been approved by the trial court or by counsel for the State and appellant, and therefore cannot be considered under the terms of Article 759a, section 1(E), V.A.C.C.P.",4,Analysis
Such allegation was sufficiently definite as to how he attempted to procure her.,4,Analysis
"State, supra, on motion for rehearing, after reviewing our decisions and the Federal Decisions we overruled a similar contention but made it plain that by such holding we did not condone any arbitrary disregard of the Constitutional mandate which imposes upon women as a class the inescapable duty of jury service.",4,Analysis
"State, 352 S.W. 2d 747, we overruled a similar contention in holding that a prior federal narcotic conviction for a like offense could be used under Art. 63, supra, to enhance punishment for a violation of Art. 725b, supra.",4,Analysis
The admission of the testimony of the prosecutrix that appellant was trying to sexually attack her and that he had enormous strength and she had none does not present reversible error under the record.,4,Analysis
"So construing Art. 1404b P.C. before and after its amendment in 1955, we overrule appellant’s contention that the statute is void.",4,Analysis
"In Thurman, supra, two state’s witnesses testified that they did not get close enough to the appellant to smell his breath; neither testified that he was intoxicated.",4,Analysis
"In view of our disposition of this appeal, a statement of the facts will not be deemed necessary other than to state that formal Bill of Exception No. 2 recites that during the cross-examination of the prosecuting witness appellant developed that the witness had previously made a written statement to the police and district attorney concerning the offense on trial.",4,Analysis
"In view of the evidence and the court’s instruction to the jury, no reversible error is shown.",4,Analysis
It is apparent from the above facts that the contention presents no error.,4,Analysis
It is apparent that such arguments violated no mandatory statute.,4,Analysis
"In Toombs, the state’s one witness failed to testify that he smelled liquor on appellant’s breath and he failed to express an opinion that appellant was intoxicated.",4,Analysis
No such burden exists in cases involving First Amendment rights.,4,Analysis
"Officer Geffert’s testimony and the other evidence which shows that pursuant to appellant’s instructions the officers did go to the cabin, searched the same and in the search found the narcotic paraphernalia and barbiturates which appellant stated he had in the cabin is sufficient to corroborate appellant’s oral confession.",4,Analysis
Rather it has the potential to intrude upon the very first of the Amendments of the Constitution.,4,Analysis

"Appellant argues that it is necessary to allege that the abortion was unlawful, because under some circumstances an abortion may be legally performed.",2,Issue
"Appellant first contends that the indictment in this case is fatally defective in that it does not allege that the appellant “unlawfully”, “willfully”, and “designedly” performed the abortion in question, and therefore fails to meet the requirements of Article 1191, V.A.P.C.",2,Issue
"It is his contention that in the case at bar, at most, the State made out a case of bringing on a premature birth.",2,Issue
He further contends that no evidence was adduced showing that the life of the fetus in the womb was destroyed.,2,Issue

"The State contends that under the authority of these cases, and the very general objections made by appellant, no error is shown.",2,Issue

“Appellant also contends that the information is defective because it does not charge that the act complained of was prohibited or unlawful.,2,Issue

"Appellants contend there is no proof of threats of death or great bodily harm as that term is defined by Art. 1185, V.A.P.C., to support the submission to the jury of the issue of rape by threats, and therefore that the court below erred in submitting same over their objection.",2,Issue

Defendant Boonprakong moved for dismissal of this action because it fails to state a claim against him upon which relief can be granted.,2,Issue

The sole question presented us for review is the propriety of the trial judge’s action in denying bail or recognizance pending the appeal from the trial court’s order revoking probation.,2,Issue

"In his brief and in oral argument appellant contends that because the name of the drawee bank was omitted from the check, it was not a negotiable instrument, and therefore, was not the subject of forgery.",2,Issue
"Since Articles 262 to 269, V.A.P.C., were repealed by the Acts of 1959, 56th Legislature, page 34, chapter 22, section 1, we must determine on this habeas corpus hearing whether or not the facts set forth in the indictment constitute a violation of any valid penal statute.",2,Issue
Appellant next contends that the opening argument of the prosecutor presents reversible error-,2,Issue
He first insists that the court erred in overruling his motion to postpone the trial for a period of two days on the ground that the copy of the indictment served upon him while in jail did not correspond to the indictment upon which he was tried.,2,Issue

Section 35 of Article III of the Constitution prohibits the inclusion in a bill of any subject not expressed in the title.,3,Rule/Law/Holding
The evidence adduced upon the issue of appellant’s guilt of the primary offense is substantially the same as was introduced in the companion case of Blaylock v.,3,Rule/Law/Holding
Our holding that the evidence relating to the search was properly before the court disposes of appellant’s contention that without such evidence his motion for instructed verdict was improperly overruled.,3,Rule/Law/Holding
"The admission in evidence of appellant’s oral statement to the arresting officer while under arrest, which was in the nature of a confession, was error and calls for a reversal of the conviction.",4,Analysis
"Under the record, it is shown that the statement was not a part of the res gestae.",4,Analysis
Ford made no effort to conceal the shells which were delivered to him even if they had been shown to be those which were stolen.,4,Analysis
We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict finding the appellant guilty of murder with malice.,4,Analysis
"In fact, it indicated that such was not the case because appellant made no suggestion to Ford that he conceal the shells nor did he intimate to him that they had been stolen.",4,Analysis
"The record clearly reflects that the statement was made by appellant after his arrest, in conversation with the arresting officer while he was being taken to jail from the scene of the arrest.",4,Analysis
We are unable to agree that the statement was shown to be a part of the res gestae.,4,Analysis
“Nothing in this chapter applies to an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.”,4,Analysis
"It was not necessary for the information to say that the acts of defendant were contrary to the statute, when the facts alleged of themselves showed that they were contrary to the statute.”",4,Analysis
"While it is true that Mrs. Cummings did identify the shells as the ones taken from her store, she did not in anywise connect the appellant with the transaction.",4,Analysis
“We have re-examined the bill and find the only grounds of objection set forth therein to be: ‘that the oral statements made by the defendant after he had been detained and stopped by the officers were made while under arrest and inadmissible.’ It follows that the question of whether the statements were or were not a part of the res gestae was not before the trial court and therefore cannot be raised here.”,4,Analysis
We find nothing in the remarks of State’s counsel with reference to Sullivan being tried for murder which was so obviously prejudicial that its effect upon the jury could not be removed by the court’s instruction not to consider the same.,4,Analysis
* * * A variance in names so trifling that it is inconceivable that defendant could have been misled or prejudiced thereby is immaterial.,4,Analysis
* * * A variance as to name in an indictment has been held not fatal if it is not the name averred to be forged.’,4,Analysis
"The contention is that the clothing was not the subject of a lawful search and seizure, it being purely evidentiary.",4,Analysis
"There is no evidence to show that the trails between appellant’s premises and the places where the liquor was found were made by appellant, or that he had anything to do with them.",4,Analysis
Ford’s testimony did not establish that appellant knew the shells were stolen.,4,Analysis
We have carefully reviewed and considered all of the testimony adduced and have set forth above all of the pertinent testimony that the state offered.,4,Analysis
"The effect of the charge was to relieve appellant of the accusation of possession of beer, and to require the jury to find, in order to convict, that appellant possessed liquor for the purpose of sale.",4,Analysis
"This is demonstrated by the further fact that the prima facie rule regarding the possession of more than a quart of liquor in a dry area was given to the jury, and there was no reference made to the prima facie rule regarding possession of alcoholic beverages such as beer.",4,Analysis
"If there was error in the charge, it was waived by the failure of appellant to object in the trial court.",4,Analysis
"Also, the charge given was favorable to appellant and the error, if any, was harmless.",4,Analysis
"We think that appellant’s contention that the evidence is insufficient to corroborate the testimony of the two accomplices, Nations and Matthews, has merit.",4,Analysis
We find no merit in appellant’s contention that a variance existed because the check bore such printed matter as “when written in ink this check is insured * * * ” while the indictment failed to contain these printed words.,4,Analysis
"It charged the existence of facts which, if sustained, show a violation of the law.",4,Analysis
In the absence of any showing of injury or prejudice the court’s refusal to require the production of the offense report is not ground for reversal.,4,Analysis
"“By a motion to quash appellant assailed the indictment, because it omitted the charge that appellant ‘unlawfully’ possessed the intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale.",4,Analysis
"We find the evidence sufficient, as adduced by the State from the complaining witness, Jo Ann Williams, as heretofore stated by us, to overcome appellant’s contention.",4,Analysis
"However, in the case at bar, the facts are different.",4,Analysis
"We are not unmindful of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, in Baysden v. U.S., 271 Fed. 2d 325, where it was held that an affidavit for a warrant was not sufficient under Rule 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., unless it stated, in addition to the grounds or probable cause for its issuance, the names of the persons whose affidavits had been taken in support thereof.",4,Analysis
We are aware of no decision of the Supreme Court of the United States holding that such an affidavit is insufficient.,4,Analysis
This Court has often held that an affidavit identical to the one above constitutes a sufficient recitation of “probable cause”.,4,Analysis
"It would seem, therefore, that if we have properly decided this case under our Constitution and statutes then it has been properly decided under the Constitution of the United States and the holding in Mapp v. Ohio, supra.",4,Analysis
The evidence is amply sufficient to support the verdict of the jury.,4,Analysis
To hold otherwise would be tantamount to saying that an accused is entitled to a reversal of his conviction even though it is apparent that he was not injured by the rulings of the trial court.,4,Analysis
"The affidavit and warrant being valid, no error is shown in the admission of the results of the search.",4,Analysis
"“Where it clearly appears on the face of the evidence that evidence is not admissible for any purpose, the general objection will be deemed sufficient.”",4,Analysis
An examination of the report shows nothing therein which could have been used to impeach the testimony given by the witnesses Strickland and Rodgers.,4,Analysis
An examination of the affidavit shows that it recites sufficient facts and information to constitute probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.,4,Analysis
"He attacks the affidavit on the ground that it is based on hearsay, did not set forth a statement of the offense in clear, plain and intelligible language, and was insufficient to authorize the issuance of the search warrant.",4,Analysis
"At the trial, appellant objected to the admission of the evidence showing the search and the results thereof for the reason that the search warrant was void.",4,Analysis
"Since the statements of the two witnesses were made available to this Court, appellant is in no position to complain.",4,Analysis
"While the word “designedly” seems to apply only when the offense is committed by the administration of drugs or medicines, it would appear to be necessary to allege that it was done “knowingly” or “designedly” to support an indictment under this phase of the statute.",4,Analysis
"In that case, however, we discussed the Allen case and pointed out the danger of proving unnecessary ‘gory details.’ ”",4,Analysis
"The facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant the finding of the jury that the appellant shot the deceased with a gun, causing his death, and support the conviction.",4,Analysis
“Nor need the State aver in expressed terms that the act charged was ‘unlawfully’ done where the facts alleged clearly show it to be unlawful.”,4,Analysis
"“The indictment alleged that the appellant did ‘designedly thrust and force into the vagina * * Appellant contends that it is defective because it did not allege ‘unlawfully, wilfully and designedly’- We find further in the indictment the allegation that the appellant ‘did then and there by the use of said means unlawfuly, wilfully and designedly produce an abortion’ upon the prosecutrix.",4,Analysis
It was also admissible to show the intent of appellant to perform the abortion.,4,Analysis
"Appellant gave the complaining witness the drugs at the same time that he performed the operation with instruments and, as such, it was res gestae of the offense charged.",4,Analysis
Ford never positively identified the shells.,4,Analysis
Objections were made regarding the testimony concerning certain medicine and drugs given to the complaining witness.,4,Analysis
The answer to such questions did not invade the province of the jury.,4,Analysis
"This Court has held on many occasions that where counsel makes remarks that were improper, and the court immediately instructs the jury to disregard such remarks, the error is usually cured and reversal seldom results.",4,Analysis
"It certainly does not appear that the argument of State’s counsel was so material in character that, considering the evidence and circumstances and the immediate instruction of the court to the jury to disregard such argument, the rights of the appellant were so injuriously affected and the argument was so harmful as to cause this Court to hold that it was reversible error.",4,Analysis
"Under the indictment and all the proof offered, we think such argument may well have been a proper comment upon the evidence.",4,Analysis
The argument of the prosecutor in this case was merely that the life of the fetus had been destroyed.,4,Analysis
"The words “designedly”, “wilfully”, and “unlawfully” are not essential in charging the offense in this case under Article 1191, V.A.P.C., and the indictment here is not fundamentally defective.",4,Analysis
"These words were placed in the charge defining the offense, and appellant may not therefore complain of the court’s action in that regard.",4,Analysis
"Where the offense is charged by alleging other means, as in the present case, it is not necessary to allege that the act was done “designedly” or “knowingly” where, as here, the indictment alleged",4,Analysis
Whether the victim of the assault was a pedestrian or an occupant of a vehicle would not alter the rule that evidence as to the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted on the assaulted person is admissible regardless of the nature of the charge of aggravated assault contained in the indictment.,4,Analysis
We think the indictment not vulnerable to the attack.,4,Analysis
He was not asked if they were the same shells brought to him at his fish market by the appellant.,4,Analysis
A careful and thorough examination of the record fails to reveal any evidence that would constitute proof of threats.,4,Analysis
We also observe that the testimony of the witness Mrs. Cummings pertaining to the cash market value of the shells in San Jacinto County is lacking in some essential requisites and that on another trial of this cause the knowledge and competency of this witness to testify to these facts should be more fully developed.,4,Analysis
"We feel that the learned trial judge fell into error in admitting the various prior judgments of convictions without evidence to establish that appellant and his witness were the defendants therein and without first requiring the state to establish the subsection of the vagrancy statute under which they were had, in order to properly establish these offenses as ones properly coming within, the terms of the classification of offenses involving moral turpitude.",4,Analysis
We have examined the informal bills of exception appearing in the record and find no reversible error therein.,4,Analysis
The jury by their verdict resolved the disputed issues against appellant and we find the evidence sufficient to support their verdict.,4,Analysis
Appellant relies upon the decisions by this Court which hold that in prosecutions of this nature it is the court’s duty to instruct the jury as to the causal connection between the accused’s intoxication and death of the deceased necessary to convict.,4,Analysis
Under the evidence there was no issue raised that the cause of the collision and death of the deceaseds was entirely disconnected with appellant’s intoxication and therefore a defensive charge as to the causal connection was not required.,4,Analysis
We have considered the informal bills of exception contained in the statement of facts and find no reversible error therein.,4,Analysis
"We are unable to agree with the state’s contention that the indictment referred to in the question may have been that upon which appellant was on trial, rather than other indictments of which he had certified copies.",4,Analysis
"In the absence of a judgment entered of record in the minutes of the court, the appeal must be dismissed.",4,Analysis
"Where no judgment of conviction was found in the record, the Court of Criminal Appeals had no jurisdiction of the appeal.",4,Analysis
"Appellant did not testify or offer any testimony in his behalf, and we find the evidence sufficient to support the conviction.",4,Analysis
"We have carefully examined the questions complained about and find that the court sustained most of appellant’s objections and instructed the State to rephrase them, and we do not find an abuse of discretion in his rulings on the other questions.",4,Analysis
"Be that as it may, we observe that the blood which was found on the seat covers was not of prosecutrix but came from appellant’s arm.",4,Analysis
A careful reexamination of the statement of facts reveals that such an instruction was given in response to a request by appellant’s counsel.,4,Analysis
"Due to our disposition of the cause, the facts need not be set forth.",4,Analysis
"The evidence admitted without objection shows that appellant conversed freely with the officers; stated that he had “had a little at his job”, when asked if he had been drinking; and when asked about the sign on the hood of his car, answered “What sign?”",4,Analysis
"In addition, the threats must be of such nature as would operate upon the mind of the prosecutrix to such an extent to cause her to yield to the attacker.",4,Analysis
The trial court erred in submitting to the jury the issue of rape by threats.,4,Analysis
"Such an inquiry may lead a court into examination of legislative purpose, the overall statutory scheme, statutory arrangements in connected fields and the needs of the public.",4,Analysis
The testimony of the officers in the instant case is sufficient to directly connect appellant with the offense.,4,Analysis
"The question having been asked and answered before the objection, and there being no effort to have the evidence withdrawn from the jury, no error is presented warranting reversal.",4,Analysis
The fact that Sullivan was under indictment as an accessory to the murder did not foreclose proof by the State that appellant and Sullivan acted together as principals in the commission of the offense.,4,Analysis
The prior convictions were proved by certain prison records and comparison of finger prints in the manner which has been held sufficient by this Court.,4,Analysis
The jury resolved the issue of appellant’s guilt in favor of the State and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict.,4,Analysis
The record before us contains no formal bills of exception and there are no objections to the court’s charge.,4,Analysis
"The remaining ground for reversal is predicated upon the fact that the court in his charge treated the prosecution as being for possession of liquor, whereas the information alleged the possession of an alcoholic beverage, to-wit, whisky, vodka and beer.",4,Analysis
This Court held that failure to copy such words in the indictment did not create a variance.,4,Analysis
"This, we think, is sufficient if in fact such allegations are necessary.”",4,Analysis
"Since there is no statement of facts on the merits in this case, this Court cannot consider the nature of the evidence in determining whether the trial court used discretion.",4,Analysis
"Thus, there was a fatal variance between the information and the proof in two respects; i.e., the number of the cause and the date of the conviction.",4,Analysis
We agree that Tonnahill is controlling for the facts as stated in that case.,4,Analysis
We hold that the evidence was obviously not admissible for any purpose.,4,Analysis
"The sole ground for reversal relates to argument of counsel for the state to the effect that there was no evidence other than the testimony of the appellant that he had taken or was under the influence of a drug; that appellant produced some pills which he testified he had been taking, but no testimony that he told anyone that night, and that no one confirmed his testimony that he had taken the pills.",4,Analysis
The fact that the trial judge sustained objection and instructed the jury to disregard a comment upon the defendant’s failure to testify did not cure the error.,4,Analysis
"The remarks that “we don’t know that” and “the sole case for the defense has been a character witness,” and “this man was sworn in,” made in connection with argument relating to whether appellant in fact had an impediment in his speech, or which affected the way he walked, viewed in the light of the certification in the bills of exception, constituted an indirect reference to the appellant’s failure to testify and require reversal.",4,Analysis
"While it is true that when the State introduces a confession containing exculpatory statements it is ordinarily incumbent upon the court to instruct the jury that the exculpatory statements are to be regarded as true unless disproved, this is not the rule where the accused testifies before the jury in accordance with such exculpatory statements, and his defensive theory is fairly submitted to the jury.",4,Analysis
"Two points of error are presented, both complaining of the admission of evidence to the effect that appellant was taken by the officers to the stash and while under arrest he said that some of the beer was his.",4,Analysis
We find no objection in the record on the ground that appellant’s statement was inadmissible because it was made while under arrest or without warning.,4,Analysis
"The admission of the evidence complained of is not, under the record, ground for reversal.",4,Analysis
The jury resolved the fact issues against the appellant.,4,Analysis
The evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction and we find no reversible error.,4,Analysis
Appellant’s requested charge No. 1 would have instructed the jury that they could not convict appellant unless they found from the evidence that on the date in question appellant knew that women in the house were prostitutes and plying their trade at such location.,4,Analysis
The question of lack of knowledge was not raised by the evidence as an affirmative defense and the court did not err in refusing to give the instruction.,4,Analysis
Requested charge No. 3 would have instructed the jury that proof that a house bears the general reputation of a house of prostitution or general reputation of an inmate thereof as a common prostitute is not sufficient in itself to establish such as a fact.,4,Analysis
Requested charge No. 4 would have instructed the jury to acquit appellant unless they found that on the date in question an occupant of the house did engage in acts of illegal sexual intercourse.,4,Analysis
These two requested charges were evidentiary in nature and upon the weight of the evidence.,4,Analysis
In refusing to give such charges the court did not err.,4,Analysis
"There is no showing in the record what the answer of any venireman would have been, and there is nothing to show that any objectionable juror served on the jury, or that appellant exhausted his peremptory challenges, or that appellant was prejudiced because any juror had or did not have conscientious scruples against the infliction of death as a punishment for the crime of rape.",4,Analysis
No error appears in the admission of the written statement in evidence.,4,Analysis
Appellant’s guilt as a principal also depended on proof by circumstantial evidence.,4,Analysis
We have diligently reviewed the record.,4,Analysis
We shall set forth all of the evidence adduced by both the state and the appellant with references to these prior convictions.,4,Analysis
"The evidence is deemed sufficient to sustain the conviction upon appellant’s plea of guilty, and we find no error.",4,Analysis
"The trials being joined, we overrule the state’s contention that the statement of facts should not be considered because it is combined with the statement of facts in the other cases jointly tried.",4,Analysis
"Our state’s attorney before this court so concedes, and confesses error.",4,Analysis
"For such reason, the information in the instant case is insufficient.",4,Analysis
The application of this rule to the facts in this case shows no error.,4,Analysis
"From what we have said, we feel that the effectiveness of the testimony of the appellant and the witness Coleman and its credibility was substantially lessened and that the appellant did suffer prejudicial harm by the admission of the various judgments showing prior convictions.",4,Analysis
"At best, he said that they were the same type of shells.",4,Analysis
"In view of our disposition of this case, we find it unnecessary to express an opinion upon the argument complained of by state’s counsel.",4,Analysis
"These questions were actually suggestive, opinionated, conclusive questions, but they were answered in the negative.",4,Analysis
"The line of questioning pursued by the state, at the time questions were being asked appellant and the witness Coleman, was framed in such manner as to elicit the desired and necessary information to show the subsection of the vagrancy statute, for the state did inquire if the judgment showed a conviction for the offense of vagrancy, to-wit: being then and there a common prostitute, and for the offense of vagrancy, to-wit: associating with and receiving aid from known prostitutes.",4,Analysis
"The closest the state came to showing any subsection of the vagrancy statute was the reference by the witness Hamilton to the “pink complaint”, but the “pink complaint” was not entered in the evidence, and it is not before us.",4,Analysis
"While there may be merit in viewing this case from the standpoint of the admissibility or inadmissibility of the evidence relating to the prior convictions, as briefed by the appellant and the state, on the question of whether or not it was necessary to identify the appellant and the witness, we think that, properly, these prior convictions for the offense of vagrancy should be viewed and tested by the rules of admissibility of evidence showing prior convictions for offenses involving moral turpitude.",4,Analysis
We find the evidence amply sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict.,4,Analysis
There is no. evidence to support his objection.,4,Analysis
"Although the appellant’s counsel never at any time made a specific objection to the admissibility of the prior convictions for the offenses of vagrancy because they had not been shown to be ones involving moral turpitude, we think that the objections which were made to the prior judgments were sufficient to apprise the court of their admissibility.",4,Analysis
"We believe that while the objection of counsel might not have been specific, this is the type of case where any form of objection is sufficient.",4,Analysis
"For this reason, the record before us fails to raise an issue as to the voluntary nature of the confession, and the authorities upon which appellant relies have no application.",4,Analysis
"While the appellant’s counsel might not have made a specific objection to the testimony, the general rule being that an objection should be specific, naming a particular rule of evidence which will be violated by the admission of the evidence, the purpose of such a requirement is two-fold: (1) It enables the judge to understand the precise question and to make an intelligent ruling, and (2) It affords the offering party an opportunity to remedy the defect if possible.",4,Analysis
We do not agree that the motion for instructed verdict may be considered as a motion to exclude the evidence relating to the recovery of the stolen property admitted without proper objection.,4,Analysis
"It is also not clear that the trial judge would not have reconsidered and set aside his order revoking probation when it was shown at the hearing on appellant’s motion for new trial that he had even then not arrived at the age of 17, had he not been of the opinion that he was without authority to do so.",4,Analysis
"Assuming that the theft of the beer was committed during the term of probation, it is not clear that the trial judge would have exercised his discretion and revoked appellant’s probation had he known at the time that appellant while of juvenile age could not ordinarily be convicted of a criminal offense by reason of such breaking and theft.",4,Analysis
There is an absence of any showing as to appellant’s ability to make such payment or that his failure was willful.,4,Analysis
The trial court’s finding that appellant was in fact 17 years of age at the time of his trial cannot be sustained in view of the evidence mentioned.,4,Analysis
"The trial judge refused to grant leave to appellant to file the motion for new trial but heard the evidence, at the conclusion of which he stated that he was of the opinion that he had no authority to grant permission to file the motion for new trial after 10 days had elapsed and overruled it.",4,Analysis
"The indictment was returned February 15, 1961, and on the following day appellant waived a jury and, joined by his court-appointed counsel, waived the 10 days allowed by statute to prepare for trial.",4,Analysis
"While this is a case of first impression, we think that Article 815, V.A.C.C.P., allowing appellants to enter into recognizance and to remain on bail, pending appeal, when the punishment assessed does not exceed fifteen years, here controls.",4,Analysis
"In the absence of a bond or recognizance on appeal, or a showing that appellant is in jail, we are without jurisdiction of this misdemeanor appeal.",4,Analysis
We have examined the remaining bills of exception and fail to find error reflected thereby.,4,Analysis
There was no error in permitting the witness Coffman to testify that after the day charged in the indictment he had a conversation with appellant in which appellant asked him to go talk to Hartwell and offer him a thousand dollars “if he wouldn’t push the case or if he would drop it”.,4,Analysis
There was no error in admitting the testimony relating to appellant’s res gestae statement that he had been in the “pen” before.,4,Analysis
We find no reversible error reflected by the testimony of Hartwell that he felt he was going to be killed by the assault.,4,Analysis
"Having disposed of the most difficult question in the case, we pass on to the sufficiency of the evidence to support this conviction for assault with intent to murder.",4,Analysis
"Under the evidence, we find no error in the giving of the charge.",4,Analysis
Proof was offered that Hale County was a dry area; and also of the prior conviction alleged and that the appellant was the same person so convicted.,4,Analysis
"This was predicated upon the evidence concerning the pursuit by appellant from the cafe to the roadside park, his assault with the flexible club at that point, his continued pursuit after the Hartwells left the park, coupled with his act of ramming the rear end of the automobile in which the Hartwells were riding and his act of stopping at the filling station in question and alighting, armed with the weapon heretofore described.",4,Analysis
"The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction, and no error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.",4,Analysis
"The court submitted the issue of appellant’s guilt to the jury upon a charge on the law of principals; gave application to the provisions of Art. 42 V.A.P.C., by instructing the jury that if appellant, while in perpetration of a robbery, through mistake or accident did kill the deceased, he would be guilty of murder with malice and submitted to the jury the question as to the voluntary nature of appellant’s written statements introduced in evidence.",4,Analysis
"We are aware of no statute which makes it an offense to “unlawfully and wilfully Pass-insufficient Clearance”, and it is clear that if there were such a statute it would be void for indefiniteness.",4,Analysis
"We have been furnished with the record of the trial de novo in County Court from which we find that the relator herein was tried and found guilty of violating Art. 6701d, Sec.",4,Analysis
We are unable to agree with the state that because the court instructed the jury on the law of principals a charge on circumstantial evidence was not required.,4,Analysis
"Under the record, a charge on circumstantial evidence should have been given.",4,Analysis
"Proof of his mere presence on the premises at the time the offense was committed, although made by direct evidence, is insufficient to support the conviction.",4,Analysis
Appellant’s guilt of possessing the morphine is made to depend upon the inference to be drawn by his presence on the premises on the occasion in question and the other facts and circumstances shown by the evidence.,4,Analysis
"Although an officer testified that he had observed appellant enter the premises on four or five different occasions, he did not testify, positively, that appellant lived in the apartment but did testify that Linda Blaylock lived there.",4,Analysis
"While he was present on the premises when it was found, there is no direct evidence that he owned or controlled the premises.",4,Analysis
Such omissions constitute an undue restriction upon appellant’s defense and call for reversal.,4,Analysis
"Nowhere in the court’s charge do we find any reference to threats, and the charge on the right to defend against apparent as well as real danger did not encompass the threats or the words, acts or conduct of the injured party.",4,Analysis
We have again carefully considered the record in the light of appellant’s contentions and remain convinced that it does not show reversible error.,4,Analysis
"Finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.",4,Analysis
"Under the State’s evidence showing that Sullivan was present and participated with appellant in the killing of the deceased, the court correctly charged the jury on the law of their acting together as principals.",4,Analysis
"Our examination of the record reflects that the State did show, by the witness Evans, that Sullivan made a second written statement on April 21, but that the same was not introduced in evidence.",4,Analysis
"When State’s counsel withdrew his objection to Sullivan testifying, the witness could have then been called by appellant to testify as if no objection had been made.",4,Analysis
The State’s evidence shows that the deceased operated a liquor store in the City of Houston.,4,Analysis
He then charged on provoking the difficulty.,4,Analysis
This was a proper submission of the defensive issue raised by the evidence.,4,Analysis
"The court charged on appellant’s right of self-defense against an unlawful attack by Hartwell, based upon the testimony that Hartwell made the first overt act with the lantern.",4,Analysis
"Plaintiff, on oral argument, stated that the challenged documents were submitted for the purpose of estopping the Government from asserting as a defense the untimely filing of plaintiff's claim and action.",4,Analysis
"The Government further contends that such documents are hearsay, violate the Best Evidence Rule, and are not properly authenticated.",4,Analysis
"Further, while we are not aware of the nature of the off-the-record discussions, we find it necessary to add that, although it is the role of the prosecutor to draw such indictments as the grand jury directs, he may not give advice as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in any matter, nor may he in any way seek to influence the grand jury to find or not to find any indictment, nor may he take part in any of the grand jury's deliberations, as these are all matters wholly within the exclusive province of the grand jury.",4,Analysis
The language of the court in Pipes is equally appropriate to the matter now on appeal before this Court.,4,Analysis
"But we are not willing to speculate that they were not, nor should a defendant be asked to guess and be burdened with proving that he was.",4,Analysis
"Granted, we are not able to say with any certitude that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these discussions.",4,Analysis
The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants.,4,Analysis
"Thus, it is required in Guam that a transcript be made and that copies be provided for both the prosecuting attorney and each defendant.",4,Analysis
It therefore appears that Mr. Cate would not be liable for any of the present judgment.,4,Analysis
"Although plaintiff has no record of the cancellation the testimony received indicates that a record of the cancellation might not have been made or if made, might have been destroyed.",4,Analysis
"Second, although this statute as written is violative of the Constitution, and by authority of Orr v. Orr void, this court need not reach this result, or indeed a federal constitutional issue, in this case.",4,Analysis
"Thus, even if §139 were found to be void as urged, there is a basis for the award of child support.",4,Analysis
Off-the-record discussions may lend credence to such criticism.,4,Analysis
Too often grand juries are criticized for being mere rubber stamps of the prosecution.,4,Analysis
"The jury resolved the issues of fact, and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding.",4,Analysis
This Court finds that Rule 408 creates an exception for the admissibility of evidence otherwise inadmissible if offered for purposes other than to prove liability.,4,Analysis
"Plaintiff does not seek to establish that the documents of compromise are an admission of liability on the part of the Government, but merely that negotiations were ongoing they are admissible.",4,Analysis
"With regard to the Best Evidence argument, where an original is unobtainable, or within the control of the party opponent, the Rule creates an exception for the introduction of copy in lieu of the original.",4,Analysis
"Based on the foregoing, this Court finds no ground to strike the documents as submitted by plaintiff, and accordingly DENIES the Government's motion.",4,Analysis
The facts distinguish this case from the recent case of Hicks v.,4,Analysis
"Therefore, defendant shall be allowed an additional period within which to file her answer in this case.",4,Analysis
It would seem inequitable for this court to bind defendant to the two (2) month requirement for response when due in part to clerical error by the clerk the summons was served in a defective state.,4,Analysis
The Court bases its decision upon the sufficiency of the summons mailed in December pursuant to the order for publication.,4,Analysis
"However, assuming that these sections apply to the petitioners, it would seem that the Director conversely has no authority to remove prisoners from the Halfway House Correctional Facility without the express approval of the parole board.",4,Analysis
"In some cases the gravity of certain offenses could justify the disciplinary removal of a prisoner from work release prior to a full hearing; however, no exigent circumstances to justify such removal have been shown by the Government to exist in the cases at bar.",4,Analysis
"This is not to minimize the seriousness of the offenses charged; however, benefits afforded a prisoner on a work-release program are similar to those of a prisoner on parole, thus requiring greater rights to a hearing than might normally be associated with general prison discipline and administrative procedures.",4,Analysis
"We do not deem it necessary to review the holding of this Court in Ex Parte Jonischkies, 88 Texas Cr.",4,Analysis

"We here think that the trial judge fully understood the question, but that he later fell into error in admitting the testimony after he had stated: “Gentlemen, in this case the injuries were less than death.",4,Analysis
"Thus, the bare fact that compensation to plaintiff under the Worlonen's Compensation Law would come from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund is sufficient to bar plaintiff's claim under Government Code §37005.",4,Analysis
The uncontradicted testimony of Root and Reyes suggest that the right to confront and produce witnesses was limited when their cases were heard.,4,Analysis
"Although the Fund may recoup these payments from the Authority on an annual basis pursuant to this Section, the liability for Workmen's Compensation payments is upon the Government of Guam.",4,Analysis
"Where it appears clearly from the tenor of the statute that employees of the Authority are employees of the Government, and the Legislature specifically exempts certain people from the operation of the statue, it is strong evidence that the",4,Analysis
"Where the court is faced with two interpretations, one of which would hold the statute wholly void and the other of which would uphold the statute, it is clear that the legislative intent must be the latter interpretations.",4,Analysis
"This Court believes that the order of September 11th clearly circumvents this argument, and that said order is an unconditional prohibition upon the Government from using any information relating to questions not properly answered.",4,Analysis
"This Section does not, therefore, override the specific provisions of Government Code 37005 that make the Workmen's Compensation Law the exclusive remedy against the Government of Guam in some cases.",4,Analysis
"In the latter case we said that the inquiry “* *•* is not whether there is in the indictment such specific allegation of the details of the charge as would make it good on demurrer, but whether the indictment describes a class of offense of which the court has jurisdiction and alleges the defendant to be guilty.”",4,Analysis
We feel that Longoria is distinguishable from the case at bar in that the evidence showed that one of the appellants stated: “This lady was scared and asked me if we were going to beat her up.,4,Analysis
The punishment assessed is within the limits prescribed by statute.,4,Analysis
"As presented, the court’s rulings do not call for reversal.",4,Analysis
"The question of the validity of a penal provision of the Election Code was not before the court in that case, and the same is not authority in the case at bar.",4,Analysis
"If the presence of notice to the Legislature and the public has caused a difference of opinion in this Court, after careful study and with the aid of able counsel, then it is apparent that such notice was not brought home to the members of the Legislature or the public.",4,Analysis
"City of Farmersville, 67 S.W. 2d 235 (differentiated by the Supreme Court of this State in Ex Parte Jimenez, supra), wherein the caption failed to mention an important change in the law, the Supreme Court held that the caption of the Act in the power company case was misleading in that it affirmatively suggested that the Act did not contain the provision in question.",4,Analysis
Such a holding in nowise affects the validity of Subdivision (b) or any of the other civil provisions of the Election Code.,4,Analysis
This would not vitiate the judgment where the indictment so alleged and the conviction was upon a plea of guilty to the offense charged in the indictment.,4,Analysis
The provision in the caption that nothing in the election code shall be construed as repealing or in any way affecting the legality of any penal provision of the existing law does not suggest to me that the statute contains no penal provision.,4,Analysis
This is especially true because one or more of the acts for which a fine or imprisonment is provided in the election code do not appear to have been punishable as offenses under existing statutes.,4,Analysis
"262 to 269 P.C., I agree that the doing of the acts set forth in the indictment is punishable under Art. 302 P.C., which defines the offense of perjury, and that the relator should be remanded to custody.",4,Analysis
"“The reason underlying this constitutional requirement is that fraud and deception in the enactment of legislation is made less likely if the caption, which is often the only part of the ■ bill read by busy members of the Legislature, fully apprises the members of the contents of the bill itself.",4,Analysis
We know of no authority which sustains appellant’s contention that he was entitled to have a jury finding on the issue raised by his plea of former jeopardy before any evidence was heard on the charge of murder.,4,Analysis
"Appellant’s contention is based upon the fact that Officer Garrison, in addition to telling appellant that if he took the test and it showed he was intoxicated, it would be used against him, also told him that if it showed that he was not intoxicated, he would be released.",4,Analysis
We find nothing in the officer’s statement to appellant that if he passed the test he would be released to render his consent to take the test involuntary.,4,Analysis
They do not disclose that the conviction was for assault with intent to murder with malice or that the offense was committed by laying in wait.,4,Analysis
We find no merit in appellant’s contention that the court erred in permitting the State to introduce in evidence a photograph of a Harger Drunkometer Machine over the objection that it was not shown to be a true picture of the machine used at the time appellant was given the breath test.,4,Analysis
The judgment and sentence as recorded in the minutes show a conviction for assault with intent to murder.,4,Analysis
The fact that the felony punishment has been reduced since the conviction is not ground for attacking the conviction by habeas corpus.,4,Analysis
We further hold that the discharge of the jury at the former trial did not constitute jeopardy barring another trial.,4,Analysis
We find that the trial court did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the jury could not agree upon a verdict and in discharging them and declaring a mistrial.,4,Analysis
"While the cases cited by appellant sustain his contention that he was entitled to introduce evidence before the jury for the purpose of discharging the burden resting upon him of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his plea was true, there is no showing in this record that appellant tendered evidence before the jury in support of his plea after the court had properly refused to permit such evidence to be offered in advance of a hearing on the merits.",4,Analysis
We remain convinced that Judge Todd did not err in overruling the plea of former jeopardy.,4,Analysis
"Since there is no showing that appellant agreed to the discharge of the jury, it will be assumed that he did not.",4,Analysis
"“After the cause is submitted to the jury, they may be discharged when they cannot agree and both parties consent to their discharge; or the court may in its discretion discharge them where they have been kept together for such time as to render it altogether improbable that they can agree.”",4,Analysis
The motion for new trial is but a pleading and as such must be supported by proof.,4,Analysis
We do not deem the defects such as would render the judgment insufficient for use in charging a subsequent offense of driving while intoxicated.,4,Analysis
The jury chose to accept the testimony of the State’s witnesses and reject that of the appellant and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict.,4,Analysis
The record contains no formal bills of exception and there are no objections to the court’s charge.,4,Analysis
We have carefully examined the informal bills of exception appearing in the statement of facts to the court’s rulings on the admission or rejection of testimony and the appellant’s objections to certain jury argument by State’s counsel and find no reversible error therein.,4,Analysis
"In any event, the exercise of discretion will be measured by the time the jury have been kept together, considered in the light of the nature of the case and the evidence.”",4,Analysis
“As to whether the jury have been held for such a time as to render it ‘altogether improbable that they can agree’ is addressed to the discretion of the judge.,4,Analysis
"The reference by State’s counsel in his closing argument to the appellant’s record in the hands of the district attorney and that he had previously entered a plea of guilty to carrying a concealed weapon does not present reversible error as such statement was clearly invited and in reply to the argument of appellant’s counsel when he stated to the jury, in substance, that the State had appellant’s record and if he had done anything wrong they would know about it.",4,Analysis
"Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the evidence is deemed sufficient to show penetration.",4,Analysis
The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.,4,Analysis
"The charge given by the court, under the evidence presented, was sufficient; hence no error is shown.",4,Analysis
"Under the rules above stated, the check in the instant case was clearly an instrument which could be the subject of forgery.",4,Analysis
"We have carefully examined all of the authorities cited by both the State in its brief and also all of the numerous cases cited in Massoletti, supra.",4,Analysis
We do not feel that the testimony of the doctor solved any issue in the case.,4,Analysis
It has been consistently held that a variance between the complaint and the information as to the date when the offense was committed is fatal to the validity of the information.,4,Analysis
The newly discovered evidence would have only tended to impeach the testimony of the State’s witnesses and is not a ground for new trial in this state.,4,Analysis
"This testimony was no doubt prejudicial and inflamatory to the rights of the appellant before the jury, and it probably resulted in the imposition of a heavier penalty than would have been imposed absent this testimony.",4,Analysis
This was clearly an effort to impeach the witness upon an immaterial matter and was properly excluded by the court.,4,Analysis
"There being no formal bills of exception or statement of facts containing the argument complained of, this matter is not before us for review.",4,Analysis
We have examined the authorities cited by appellant and they do not support such a holding.,4,Analysis
"While the evidence may show that appellant emptied his own gun on Dodson before using Dodson’s gun, it does not cause a variance.",4,Analysis
"It charges appellant with committing the robbery by exhibiting “a firearm, to-wit: gun”.",4,Analysis
"We find the indictment to be in the usual form, which has been approved many times.",4,Analysis
"While it is true that the exhibits had been identified by another witness, in the absence of anything in the record to the contrary, we must be bound by the court’s qualification of the informal bill when he stated that they had not been exhibited to the jury as they were still in the sack.",4,Analysis
We find no basis to disturb the punishment assessed by the jury.,4,Analysis
"Under the facts in this case, we do not find the punishment too severe nor excessive.",4,Analysis
"The taking of the money, the robbery, was completed before the second firearm or gun came into being in the cause.",4,Analysis
"The assistant supervisor, so far as this record discloses, had no authority to carry a pistol and had no authority to deputize appellant so as to authorize him to do so.",4,Analysis
"We hold that where, as here, no facts are alleged in the complaint which, if true, constitute an offense, and no facts are alleged which show that offense was meant to be charged, a final conviction under such complaint is void and may be attacked by habeas corpus.",4,Analysis
All of the statements in the confession were consistent with guilt.,4,Analysis
We have examined the record with care and fail to find any undisputed evidence which would render the confession inadmissible as a matter of law.,4,Analysis
We also remain convinced that we properly disposed of appellant’s contention relating to the court’s charge on exculpatory statements on original submission.,4,Analysis
"We observe, however, that the instruction on exculpatory statements found in the court’s charge appears to be sufficient under the rule stated in 1 Branch’s Ann.",4,Analysis
We do not find in appellant’s confession any statement which would exculpate him.,4,Analysis
"The remaining ground for reversal relates to the court’s charge wherein the jury was instructed that if the statement of appellant, introduced in evidence, contained exculpatory matters, the state would be bound thereby unless shown to be untrue under all the evidence in the case.",4,Analysis
The variance in the instant case between the original indictment and the copy was not of such a material nature as to mislead the appellant.,4,Analysis
We have concluded that the evidence is sufficient to corroborate the testimony of the accomplice and sufficient to authorize the jury to accept her testimony given at the trial and to disbelieve the defense presented.,4,Analysis
The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction of the appellant as charged.,4,Analysis
"Such verdict, not being responsive to the crime charged and submitted to the jury was a nullity and could not support the judgment and sentence entered by the court.",4,Analysis
The verdict returned by the jury finding appellant guilty of the offense of “molesting” is clearly not responsive to the crime charged in the first count of the indictment.,4,Analysis
In view of our disposition of the case a summary of the facts is unnecessary.,4,Analysis
The evidence is deemed sufficient to sustain the allegations of the complaint and information.,4,Analysis
Proof that the named female was procured “to be” at the place named for the purpose of meeting and having sexual inter•course with a male person constituted an offense under the statute.,4,Analysis
"The other contentions presented have been considered, and they do not show error.",4,Analysis
