820,"Dated this 12th day of December, 1978.",1,Facts
554,"Unfortunately, there was some confusion at the October 25, 1975 hearing because it was only halfway through the proceedings that the Court was made to realize that the appellant had not been formally charged with the commission of another offense, i.e. by indictment or information, as required by the Code.",2,Issue
577,"In this appeal, appellant contends: (1) that Guam Criminal and Correctional Code §28.45 and §28.50 are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and the prosecution of the appellant thereunder violated her constitutional right to due process of law; and (2) the evidence presented against appellant was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam; and (3) the evidence presented was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not she violated Guam's obscenity law.",2,Issue
598,We now turn to appellant's contention that Guam's obscenity statute fails to comply with the specificity requirements of Miller v. California and is therefore unconstitutional on its face.,2,Issue
600,Appellant argues that the examples set forth in Miller describe sexual conduct while the Guam statute does not provide any definition or any example of what forms of sexual conduct are being regulated.,2,Issue
607,Appellant also contends that judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the Miller specificity requirements does not rectify the statute's unconstitutionality.,2,Issue
608,"The rationale for this proposition is that the Miller Court had included in its opinion language to the effect that""... existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.""",2,Issue
610,"Appellant argues that this reference to statutes ""existing"" at the time Miller was decided precludes judicial construction of statutes passed after the decision, and therefore Guam's statute, which had been passed approximately three years after Miller, is not capable of being ""saved"" by judicial construction.",2,Issue
614,"In an alternative context, appellant contends that even if judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the specificity requirements is valid, such construction does not cure the constitutional defect as applied to appellant.",2,Issue
615,"This contention is premised on the proposition that the Guam statute is facially defective, a proposition with which we are not in agreement.",2,Issue
618,"The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest.",2,Issue
619,"The question that must first be answered is whether the phraseology ""obscene act"" and obscene exhibition of his (sic) body"" was sufficient as notice to appellant that her conduct was proscribed.",2,Issue
624,Appellant's next contention is that the evidence presented against her at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction in that the Government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam.,2,Issue
633,Appellant's final contention is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not appellant violated Guam's obscenity law.,2,Issue

686,"The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (citations omitted); (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a",2,Issue
755,This is an interlocutory appeal after the Trial Court granted Defendant's motion to suppress a firearm which was seized after a search warrant was issued for the search of Defendant's house.,2,Issue
756,The sole issue before us is whether the affidavit and the testimony given to the judge issuing the search warrant were legally sufficient.,2,Issue
788,"If the warrant issued upon a showing of fact which was inherently incredible or false or deliberately misleading, the warrant was issued without probable cause.",2,Issue
798,"Appellants' claim for relief is based on a 1972 Three-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides that all off-island teachers whose performance had been rated satisfactory would be offered similar reemployment by March 1 of the teacher's termination year, so long as the government of Guam policies provide for such hiring of teachers .",2,Issue
806,"Appellants contend that the notice requirements under the Claims Act were substantially complied with because plaintiffs followed the grievance procedures contained in Article IV of the 1972 Collective Bargaining Agreement, thus giving the Government at least indirect notice of their desire to bring suit.",2,Issue
811,Appellants also argue that the sovereign immunity doctrine does not prevent litigants from seeking equitable relief compelling government officials to perform their duties properly (in this case requiring the Department of Education to issue contracts which become effective retroactively with full pay).,2,Issue
553,"This appeal concerns the revocation of appellant's release on bail by the Superior Court on October 24, 1975.",2,Issue
555,"Although the Government tried to argue that the Complaint filed against the accused was sufficient for the Superior Court to have revoked his bail, Section 1.17 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code clearly states that an information may not be filed until there has been a preliminary examination and an order holding defendant to answer under Section 45.80.",3,Rule/Law/Holding

612,"We find that it would be inconsistent with notions of due process, and therefore inconceivable as in inference, to interpret the Court's meaning to be that an obscenity statute currently active in a State's law may or may not be constitutional, depending solely on whether it was enacted prior to or after the decision in Miller.",5,Conclusion
613,"While we acknowledge that the language of the Guam statute is in large part archaic, we do not find that it is on that basis alone unconstitutional.",5,Conclusion
616,"Nevertheless, a review and disposition of whether §28.45 and §28.50 are unconstitutional as applied to the specific conduct of appellant is appropriate here.",5,Conclusion
621,"We find that the language of the statute provided appellant with adequate notice of the illegality of her conduct, and that therefore it is not incumbent upon us to reach the propounded issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional as construed to apply to appellant’s conduct.",5,Conclusion
622,"The use of the terminology ""obscene act"" and ""obscene exhibition"" is therefore sufficiently definite in legal meaning as to have provided appellant with notice of the charge against her.",5,Conclusion
623,"Accordingly, we conclude that the language of §28.45 and §28.50, and particularly that language of §28.50(y), gave adequate notice to appellant that her conduct was within the prohibition of the statute.",5,Conclusion

777,"If, after setting aside any material that is the subject of the charge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth, there is sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, an evidentiary hearing is not even required.",5,Conclusion
783,"This condensed statement of the contents of the Affidavit is sufficient to point out that ""CRI"" had given information to the police concerning two buys before the one at Rico's house and furnished information which had never been found to be inaccurate.",5,Conclusion
789,"However, no showing of this kind was made in the trial court.",5,Conclusion
790,"The trial judge erroneously substituted his own view of the facts for that of the issuing officer after taking evidence which was not relative to the issue of the reliability of ""CRI"" as an informant.",5,Conclusion
