"The government appeals, arguing that the mere fact that the defendant's supervisor told him to go upstairs and talk to certain agents did not result in a custodial interrogation.",1,Facts
The plaintiffs have argued that as an appellate court we should not disturb the express findings of the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous.,1,Facts

"Defendant argues that it is impossible to reconcile plaintiff's position with the language of §6500.19 which mentions ""claims against"" GMH.",1,Facts

Does this violate his freedom of expression?,2,Issue
Careful consideration has been given as to whether §17402 is more inclusive or more burdensome than necessary to further legitimate government purposes.,2,Issue
"It is unnecessarily restrictive and beyond a ""reasonable"" relationship to include all ""permitted signs"" in an effort to specifically regulate ""advertising signs"".",2,Issue
"The Territory's arguments to the contrary, the Court could vacate and resentence defendant under its broad powers pursuant to §1.07(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code.",2,Issue

"On the face of the authority submitted by the Government, People v. Carlos G.

"The claim is for ""all injuries proximately caused by the negligence... of the Government of Guam, its officers and employees, for injuries arising out of the wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment of claimant.. .said wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment having occurred on May 1, 1976, and May 2, 1976.""",4,Analysis
Here there is no question that the claim and complaint sound in negligence.,4,Analysis
The Court notes that such a claim may often be prepared by a lay person of limited education.,4,Analysis
The government has all the tools of any civil suit to refine the plaintiff's theory before trial.,4,Analysis
"However, here it seems clear that the trial court chose to ignore certain representations made in open court as to the terms of immediate payment upon the sale of the property in question.",4,Analysis
"The merits as to the actual rights and obligation between the buyers and sellers are not subject of this appeal; the only issue before us is whether the January 8, 1979 Order of the Superior Court purporting to enforce a settlement agreement made to the court by the parties during trial was error.",4,Analysis
"""It is generally believed that one of the reasons the statute was enacted was to regulate the many businesses on Guam which have signs entirely in a language other than English or Chamorro that were reported to be advertising pornographic materials for sale.",4,Analysis
"Beyond creating a chilling effect on filing a claim with the government because a plaintiff would lose all should he be mistaken in his theory, this reading also creates troublesome due process problems as such an irrevocable election would have to e made before the plaintiff has the opportunity for any sort of discovery.",4,Analysis
"First, we have determined that the defendants-appellants may prosecute this appeal independently of any partnership agreement which it might have with other defendants.",4,Analysis
"In the normal course of business dealings, a mortgage or some similar security interest would be expected, and it is the opinion of this Court that granting a mortgage in favor of the defendants would do less violence to the intention of the parties, while at the same time protecting defendant's equitable interests in the property which it was conveying.",4,Analysis
"Also, the normal presumption that a seller of realty will require a mortgage or security agreement, made it necessary for the trial court to include such a mortgage requirement in its order to compel settlement.",4,Analysis
The Court of notes that this statute applies to commercial as well as noncommercial speech.,4,Analysis
The presumption is that the legislature intended to achieve a consistent body of law.,4,Analysis
"In the absence of an irreconcilable conflict, or where two provisions of legislation are so clearly repugnant as to vital matters which they relate, courts should construe all acts harmoniously where such construction is reasonably possible.",4,Analysis
Rather it has the potential to intrude upon the very first of the Amendments of the Constitution.,4,Analysis
A suit filed under the Claims Act is a very narrow and limited area for relief.,4,Analysis
"This is a very strange result, and there is no indication that this was the intent of the legislature.",4,Analysis
"While it is true that the question of a mortgage was never discussed by the parties in open court, it seems very unlikely that any party would contemplate transferring over an interest in realty without an adequate security interest.",4,Analysis
"Guam's Government Claims Act differs from those of many other jurisdictions, for while the act waives the sovereign immunity of the territory, it does not indemnify or immunize the employee.",4,Analysis
"The Court fears, however, that this procedure would not necessarily solve defendant's problem.",4,Analysis
"The Court notes that defendant's proper and least problematic method to obtain his appeal is by way of writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, or in this Court.",4,Analysis
"The Court believes that a law requiring any permitted sign, no matter how big or small, on any land, be it public or private, in any language other than Chamorro or English to have a translation into either which ""must predominate the sign"", [has] a chilling effect on such a protected mode of expression.",4,Analysis
"Where no inconsistency strong enough to evoke a repeal exists, a repeal by implication will not be found.",4,Analysis
"Section 9 of that Act provided that the provisions of §8 would expire automatically one year from the effective date of that act, which was December 24, 1975.",4,Analysis
It is the opinion of this Court that §6500.13 was revived by §6 of P.L.,4,Analysis
The legislature has made the determination that it will make it possible to proceed against the territory rather than the employee on negligence claims.,4,Analysis
"Therefore, the deletion of reference to the Claims Act would have been meaningless unless, as plaintiff argues, it eliminated any need to resort to the procedures of the Claims Act when suit is filed against GMH.",4,Analysis
"However, it must be remembered that at the time of the May 11, 1977 deletion §6500.19 was already in effect.",4,Analysis
"Additional moral justification may have been due to the complaints by numerous Japanese tourist that some of these signs contained offensive or shocking language.""",4,Analysis
"Thus, protection of the morals of the public might have been an additional reason for enacting the statute.",4,Analysis
"The filing and recordation of the Notice of Levying on Real Property in the Department of Land Management, Government of Guam, creates a lien on the property of the defendants.",4,Analysis
"The public interests being an ""...increased awareness of the content or message contained in signs used by island businesses for advertising purposes by the English and Chamorro speaking population for the purpose of greater patronizing of such places of business, and the strengthening of the island economy by capturing the attention of English speaking tourists and the predominantly English and Chamorro consumer on Guam.""",4,Analysis
The Court is of the opinion that he foregoing Order involves a controlling issue of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the Order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.,4,Analysis
No such burden exists in cases involving First Amendment rights.,4,Analysis
"Such a position does not take, into account Government Code §6500.20, which specifically allows ""further proceedings against the employee"" if ""the Court certifies that it would have awarded the claimant more but for the limitations of 6500.13.""",4,Analysis
That section expressly states that the Government Claims Fund will not be used to pay for claims against GMH.,4,Analysis
The general trend of authority is against an interpretation of repeal by implication.,4,Analysis
This case is hereby dismissed.,5,Conclusion
The motion is GRANTED.,5,Conclusion
"For the above-stated reasons, the COURT DENIES the motion.",5,Conclusion
The motion to dismiss causes of action four and five is DENIED.,5,Conclusion
The motion to dismiss as to these counts is therefore DENIED.,5,Conclusion
That covers the law suit and that takes care of that.,5,Conclusion

"Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Writ of Attachment and the Notice of Levying on Real Property be and same are hereby vacated, set aside and dissolved.",5,Conclusion
"That all permitted signs are illegal per se if not in English or Chamorro or without a translation into either, is contradictory to the most basic right of a democratic society - the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.",5,Conclusion
"As a conclusion of law from the foregoing facts, the Court finds that this prejudgment attachment procedure violates the fundamental principles of due process.",5,Conclusion
"Thus there is no possibility of a Government Claims Action based on an intentional tort, and the plaintiff has not attempted to plead such a cause of action.",5,Conclusion
"Thus all of the above counts are specifically authorized by Government Code §6500.20 as more than $100,000 is claimed, and these counts are within the jurisdiction of the Court.",5,Conclusion
It is further ORDERED that plaintiff pay to defendants their costs.,5,Conclusion
"With the vacating of the November 26, 1979 Decision and Order, the appointment of a ""Special Prosecutor"" by the Superior Court is declared a nullity.",5,Conclusion
"By this standard the plaintiffs claim, though broad, is sufficient.",5,Conclusion
"For the foregoing reasons, on reconsideration, defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.",5,Conclusion
It is the Court's opinion that to grant defendant's motion would not necessarily result in a fair and just solution to this clerical error.,5,Conclusion
"While there appears to be a conflict in consistency between the Claims Act and the Civil Procedure Code regarding jury trial, it does not appear so repugnant an inconsistency that the two provisions cannot stand together.",5,Conclusion
That the petition is denied and Frankie Villagomez will remain in the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court for proper proceedings therein.,5,Conclusion
