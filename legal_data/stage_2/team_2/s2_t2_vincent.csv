75,Roy Cate was brought to Court to be examined as to his assets for payment of the judgment.,1
75,Judge Benson ruled that the statute in question deprives the parties of their right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Organic Act.,1
75,"This is especially true, when as here, we have a governing statute which speaks in terms of repeal ""to the extent of such inconsistency.""",1
75,"Plaintiff's motion for an Order to show Cause is GRANTED, and Plaintiff's attorney is to make a motion for a hearing date.",1

75,"Judgment was entered against Pacific Realty on April 9, 1979.",1
75,The Court finds his liability extended only to the period of time he was employed as a broker for Pacific Realty Company.,1
75,He admits that he personally applied for the telephone on the company's behalf and he asserts that he cancelled the phone when leaving two months later.,1
75,These billings as shown are $25.18 and the installation charge is $35.00.,1
75,It is undisputed that plaintiffs did not submit this claim to arbitration and screening.,1
75,"As noted by plaintiff in the memorandum in opposition to defendant Boonprakongs' motion, the arbitration statute has come before this Court for consideration in Civil Case No. 518-76 Van de Brug and A.",1
75,"This is a consolidation of interlocutory appeals taken from the Superior Court's denial of appellants' Motions to Dismiss indictments brought against them by the Territorial Grand Jury on February 8, 1979.",1
75,"We hold that off-the-record discussions such as occurred here are prohibited in grand jury proceedings, and accordingly vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.",1
75,"The off-the-record discussions being sufficient grounds for reversal, we decline to reach the other issues raised in this consolidated appeal.",1
75,Indictments dismissed without prejudice.,1
75,"The general rule regarding the recording of grand jury proceedings is that, in the absence of statute, the grand jury is not required to transcribe or record the proceedings brought before it.",1
75,"""Though recordation of grand jury testimony is the better practice and is required by judicial order, such recordation is not mandated by (the United States) Constitution.""",1
75,"In some jurisdictions it is required by statute that minutes of grand jury proceedings are to be kept, but are not to be revealed or to be made available, except to the court, prosecuting attorney, and persons to whom the court grants permission to inspect them, and, in the last instance, only upon notice to and after hearing the prosecuting attorney.",1
75,"Elsewhere, a court may require production of minutes of grand jury proceedings upon a showing that there is a particularized need or compelling necessity for such disclosure.",1
75,"It has been held in at' least one jurisdiction that a criminal defendant is under certain circumstances constitutionally entitled to some part of a grand jury transcript, and that under its rule-making power a court may amend existing Criminal Procedure Rules to require the recording of all evidence before the qrand jury.",1
75,"The law in the Territory of Guam provides for equally liberal recordation and disclosure of grand jury proceedings, including the affirmative duty of delivering a copy of the original transcript to each defendant or his attorney.",1
75,"The record on appeal does not disclose the contents of the discussion held off the record, or the circumstances attendant to that discussion.",1
75,It is the government's impropriety in the proceedings as well as the prejudice resulting therefrom.,1
75,"But the statute is explicit in its statement that the grand jury proceedings are to be recorded, and no allowance is made for off-the-record discussions during the course of the grand jury proceedings.",1
75,There is a certain danger in allowing off-the-record discussions to occur at any time and under any circumstances during official grand jury proceedings.,1
75,"This Court, after reviewing the order, agrees that the intent of said order is to provide a blanket prohibition on the use of any information not properly answered.",1
75,"At the time said order was issued, the Government did not make any objection to the blanket prohibition.",1
75,Too often grand juries are criticized for being mere rubber stamps of the prosecution.,1
75,"The integrity of the grand jury system, however, is certainly enhanced by keeping the entire proceeding a matter of record.",1

75,"(a) If an indictment is returned against a defendant, the reporter shall transcribe the grand jury proceedings and shall certify and deliver to the clerk of the court the original transcript and a copy thereof for the prosecuting attorney and each defendant.",1
75,The reporter shall complete such certification and delivery within ten days after the indictment is returned unless the court for good cause makes an order extending time.,1
75,The clerk shall file the original transcript and immediately deliver a copy to the prosecuting attorney and to each defendant or his attorney.,1
75,"However, no copy shall be delivered to a defendant prior to his first appearance pursuant to Section 45.30.",1
75,If the copy of testimony is not served as provided in this section the court shall on motion of the defendant continue the trial to such time as may be necessary to secure to the defendant receipt of a copy of such testimony ten days before such trial.,1
75,(b) The transcript shall not be open to the public until ten days after the delivery to the defendant or his attorney.,1
75,Thereafter the transcript shall be open to the public unless the court orders otherwise on its own motion or on motion of a party pending a determination as to whether all or part of the transcript should be sealed.,1
75,"(1) all grand jury proceedings are to be recorded, except jury's deliberation but recording during formal recess is not required if recess is actually a hiatus in proceeding is which jurors do not discuss case with other; (2) no conversation is to be allowed between jurors and witnesses during recess; (3) no off-the-record conversation is to be allowed between jurors and prosecutors regarding the case or any legal aspect of it and (4) all actions of the prosecutor and jurors should be susceptible to review to insure defendant an impartial, just and unbiased hearing.",1
75,"This matter came for hearing on May 16, 1980, to consider defendant Government's motion to strike certain documents attached in support of plaintiff's motion in opposition to summary judgment.",1
75,"Plaintiff then orally moved the court to prohibit the Government from using any information which the defendant was precluded from using pursuant to order of the court dated September 11, 1979.",1
75,"Upon hearing all the oral arguments of both parties, this court ruled to reserve decision.",1
75,This court will now consider each motion separately.,1
75,DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO STRIKE The Government contends that its motion is supported by Rule 408 of the Rules of Evidence which prohibits the admission of evidence of compromise to prove liability.,1
75,The Court fails to find weight in the Government's remaining arguments.,1
75,"As regards the authenticity of the papers, unless there exists serious doubt as to the validity of the duplicate submitted, copies will be accepted by the Court.",1
75,"It is not beyond the discretion of this Court to interpret a summary judgment proceeding as part of the overall trial, and therefore to interpret such a prohibition as applicable to such proceeding.",1
75,Plaintiff's motion prohibiting defendant from using the information referred to is hereby GRANTED.,1
75,Defendant's motion is DENIED.,1
75,Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED.,1
75,This case came before the court for trial.,1
75,"During the course of the trial, testimony of plaintiff's witnesses disclosed that at the time of the incident alleged in plaintiff's complaint, plaintiff was driving a car belonging to the Guam Power Authority, that his car was assigned to plaintiff for this work, and at the time of the incident, plaintiff was driving the car to its assigned parking space, pursuant to standing instructions of his employer, the Guam Power Authority, at the time of the incident upon which the complaint is based, plaintiff was within the scope of his employment.",1
75,Plaintiff did not willfully cause his own injury.,1
75,The Court asked for argument on this point and the issue was briefed.,1
75,"This leaves, however, the question of whether or not the Government of Guam is a third party in relation to the plaintiff.",1
75,"This much is clear, plaintiff is clearly an employee",1

Dueñas, Judge of said Court, presiding; the petitioner, Russell Wong, Deputy, Consumer Counsel, a public official, appearing and being represented by his attorney, Ronald J. Cristal, Assistant Attorney General, and Doris Camina, Director, Bureau of Budget and Management Research, a public official, appearing without counsel, whereupon the papers filed by the petitioner and the stipulation filed by the respondent and petitioner were received, the case having been argued and submitted to the Court for its decision and the Court having duly considered the matters submitted and the argument of counsel, and being fully advised in the premises, did render and file its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and, pursuant to said Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,",1

75,"This Memorandum Order follows a February 22, 1980 Order of the District Court which required the immediate return of Petitioners STRAUSS, ROOT, SANTOS and REYES to the Halfway House Community Correctional Facility from which they were transferred without due process of law.",1
75,"While the facts are different in each of the above-captioned cases, there can be no question that each Petitioner was removed from the Work Release Program of the Department of Corrections and returned to the Guam Penitentiary, Adult Main Facility without a proper hearing.",1
75,"A prisoner has certain vested rights, similar to a parolee, once he is afforced the benefits of participating in a work-release program.",1
75,No evidence was presented by the Department of Corrections to suggest that there were exigent circumstances which would justify the removal of the petitioners from the work-release hearing without a prior hearing.,1
75,"Strauss was returned to the Adult Main Facility on December 5, 1979, where at a preliminary hearing the charges were read to him and he was asked how he wanted to plead.",1
75,"Strauss was then put in closed confinement for approximately a week where he was restricted to his cell for twenty-four hours a day, except for a half hour to take a shower and fresh air.",1
75,The charges brought against Strauss had to do with an incident occurring around Thanksgiving when he called a local newspaper to complain about the fact that certain holiday furloughs had been cancelled.,1
75,"On December 11, 1979 a final hearing was held, which resulted in Strauss permanent removal from the work-release program and a demotion in step level.",1
75,"Root was returned to the Adult Main Facility sometime around March 26, 1978, and he was put into solitary confinement without the benefit of a hearing.",1
75,"On April 28, 1978 three was a reclassification hearing, where, according to his testimony, he was not given an opportunity to question witnesses regarding the assault charges brought against him.",1
75,"Santos was taken out of the work-release program and returned to the Adult Main Facility on January 6, 1980, where he was placed in solitary confinement.",1
75,"There was a final hearing on January 18, 1980, where he was charged with possession of alcohol and antagonizing another inmate.",1
75,"After the final hearing, he was placed in closed confinement for thirty days, with an additional thirty-day probation.",1
75,"Reyes was returned to the Adult Main Facility on November 25, 1978.",1
75,"He was immediately placed in closed confinement until a hearing on December 13, 1978 when he was found guilty of fighting with another inmate.",1
75,Prison officials allegedly the denied Reyes' request to produce certain witnesses.,1
75,"As developed above, the removal of a prisoner from a work-release program can result in a grievous loss of employment and certain due process standards attach to protect these rights to participate in the Step IV program.",1
75,"The February 22, 1980 Order of the District Court, returning the petitioners to the Halfway House Facility, is not a ruling on the merits of the charges against them.",1
75,"The Order was issued so that petitioners' partially vested rights could be reestablished fully, pending a fair and adequate hearing seeking to divest any such rights to work on the outside.",1
75,"The Government has failed to show any justification for not conducting an adequate hearing before petitioners' actual removal from the work-release program, and for not affording petitioners their full due process rights at such a hearing.",1
75,"Indeed, many of the 'core values of unqualified liberty' which the Supreme Court recognized that parolees enjoy, see Morrissey, supra, 408 U.S. at 482, 92 S.Ct.",1
75,"Like a parolee, a convict on work-release can pursue employment or education.",1
75,He is eligible for leaves to renew contacts with his family.,1
75,"He may also be released to participate in unsupervised activities in the community, such as shopping, recreation and visiting friends.",1
75,"This matter came on for hearing on April 4, 1980 to hear defendant, Gretchen Luttrell's, motion to quash service of summons by publication based on insufficiency of process.",1
75,"This court, upon review of all the records submitted herein, denies defendant's motion for the following reasons.",1
75,"Defendant bases her motion on the inconsistencies arising between the original summons mailed to her November 16, 1979 pursuant to the original complaint, and the summons she subsequently received December 31, 1979 mailed pursuant to plaintiff's amended complaint and order of the court for service by publication issued December 18, 1979.",1
75,The court will not consider the sufficiency of the summons mailed November which was not directed by the court for publication.,1
75,A defendant must respond prior to the expiration of the order.,1
75,"Plaintiff contends that even if a defect were to exist in the summons, over 100 days have since elapsed and as yet defendant has not filed a response, thus inferring that any response now would be untimely.",1
75,“My name is Donald Wayne Burns.,1
75,Other witnesses testified that he was kicked by appellant and his companion while lying on the ground.,1
75,Appellant was not present.,1
75,There are no formal bills of exception or objections to the court's charge.,1
75,"* * * Where did that person go, as he was walking toward you?",1
75,"The informal bills have been considered, and they show no error.",1
75,Show us where he went.,1
75,How was this defendant dressed at that time?,1
75,"Appellant testified that he had not consumed more than four large glasses of beer and, in effect, testified that he was not intoxicated.",1
75,"In describing the manner in which appellant walked, he testified : “He was walking in a weaving, staggering, unbalanced condition,” whereas Patrolman Hutson testified on cross-examination: “He didn’t stagger, he was swaying — that he was taking steps to the side, but he was listing more or less and lean____ over at an angle, not staggering.”",1
75,The judgment is affirmed.,1
75,"I asked him if he had had anything to drink, an alcoholic beverage, and he said, ‘Yes,’ he had had quite a few beers.",1
75,"His speech was thick, and at times ' it was incoherent.",1
75,There were six cans of beer in the Defendant’s automobile?,1
75,"And, how was his walk at this time?",1
75,"And, what was the condition of them at that time?",1
75,"Again, relating both to the scene, and while you had the Defendant in the jail office, did you smell anything on his breath?",1
75,"And, based on this experience on the police force, and based on your observation of the defendant, Willie Lee Bur-rage, on the 12th day of November, 1960, about 12:30 A.M., did you form an opinion as to whether or not the Defendant was intoxicated or under the influence of intoxicating liquor?",1
75,"Hartwell, the injured party, and two companions had repaired across the state line to a bar in New Mexico.",1
75,"While there, he met Betty Miller (appellant’s ex-wife and a former waitress at the bar in question), who had come from Clovis, New Mexico, with a group of eight people, one of whom was appellant.",1
75,"While appellant was engaged in other matters, Betty went to the bar, where she and Hartwell were drinking and talking when, unfortunately for all concerned, Mrs. Hartwell, who was out looking for her missing husband, entered the bar and observed what was transpiring.",1
75,"Angered at what she saw, Mrs. Hartwell approached Betty and gave her a resounding slap.",1
75,Betty testified that she would have replied in kind but was restrained.,1
75,"Following this, both groups left the bar and proceeded to their automobiles.",1
75,"Betty, according to her own testimony, approached the automobile in which the Hartwells were seated and invited Mrs. Hartwell outside.",1
75,"Upon Mrs. Hartwell’s refusal, Betty told her that Hartwell on repeated occasions had offered her money to “go with him”; this Hartwell denied.",1
75,"Mrs. Martin, a member of appellant’s party, approached the automobile in a belligerent manner, and, in defense of his wife, Hartwell hit her.",1
75,"After this, both automobiles containing the two groups left the bar and drove to a cafe.",1
75,"It was the testimony of those in appellant’s group that, while at the cafe, Hartwell said, “There is that s.o.b.",1
75,"This was denied by Hart-well, his wife, and Mrs. Venable, the only other person in the automobile.",1
75,"Neither group got out of their respective automobile, and both parties drove away from the cafe, with Hartwell’s car in the lead.",1
75,"A short distance away, Mrs. Venable stopped the automobile in which the Hartwells were riding to pick up her husband at a roadside park, and appellant also brought his automobile to a halt, alighted, and struck both Hartwell and the automobile (with the weapon which is described later in this opinion), denting the top and cracking the glass, after which Mrs. Hartwell and her husband hastily fled the scene in the Venable automobile, with appellant in hot pursuit, leaving his passengers afoot on the roadside.",1
75,He then charged on provoking the difficulty.,1
75,Hartwell testified that he was beaten into unconsciousness by means of the flexible cable.,1
75,It was shown that Hartwell sustained the loss of one tooth and a bridge containing two other teeth; one eyes was closed from swelling; his lips were swollen and he received a painful blow to one kidney; and he was hospitalized for three days.,1
75,"According to the state’s witnesses, during his assault on Hart-well, appellant, in answer to his mother’s warning that he would go to jail again if he did not stop, said, “I will kill the bastard.”",1
75,"At another juncture, when someone in the crowd attempted to call the police, appellant said, “Call the g.d law, I am not scared of them, I have been in the pen before.”",1
75,The court instructed the jury not to consider this statement.,1
75,A picture thereof is part of this record.,1
75,"The weapon, a doubled cable bound with tape, does not taper at one end as a whip, and therefore would not be properly usable to discipline animals.",1
75,"Appellant was accompanied by seven companions in his pursuit of Hartwell and his wife, and whenever the automobiles halted appellant struck at Hartwell with this weapon, and one of such blows caused a dent of over a half inch in depth in the top of a sedan.",1
75,At least one of appellant’s companions kicked Hartwell as he lay unconscious on the ground.,1
75,"Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2nd Ed., defines “gang” as a “company of persons acting together for some purpose, usually criminal, or at least not good or respectable”.",1
75,"Appellant, accompanied by Martin and six others, pursued Hartwell, assaulted him whenever the opportunity arose, and stated that he intended to kill him.",1
75,"On January 2, 1962, the District Court of Bowie County revoked a five-year probationary sentence which had been given appellant on September 11, 1961.",1
75,"The trial court refused to allow appellant to make such recognizance and ordered him confined to jail, pending his appeal from the revocation order entered by the court.",1
75,"On January 3, 1962, Judge W. A. Morrison of this court granted appellant’s application to file an original application for habeas corpus with this court, and bail was set at $5,000.00.",1
75,The able trial judge fell into error in denying appellant bail.,1
75,"The indictment was returned February 15, 1961, and on the following day appellant waived a jury and, joined by his court-appointed counsel, waived the 10 days allowed by statute to prepare for trial.",1
75,"On the same day, appellant filed application for probation stating that he had never before been convicted of a felony and said application was granted and the imposition of sentence was suspended.",1
75,"Among the conditions of probation were that he: (1) commit no offense against the laws of this or any other state or the United States, and (2) make restitution as and when directed by the probation officer and pay all costs of this proceeding.",1
75,"On April 11, 1961, motion was filed by the district attorney to revoke probation, alleging that appellant failed to comply with the conditions of his probation in that:",1
75,"“(1) Defendant was arrested on April 6, 1961, by the police and charged with breaking into a beer truck and stealing 12 cases of beer, which he admits.",1
75,“(2) Has paid no part of his court costs as instructed by the court.”,1
75,"On April 24, 1961, motion for new trial was filed and on May 3, 1961, evidence was presented and heard in connection with which it was shown that appellant had been adjudged to be a delinquent child in the Court of Domestic Relations in Potter County on December 30, 1959, the court finding in his judgment that appellant was born on November 12, 1944.",1
75,"Also, a certified copy of the birth certificate of appellant was produced and made a part of the record.",1
75,"The certification of the attending physician is shown to have been filed with the local registrar in Madison County, Alabama, on November 3, 1944, and gives the date of birth as October 7, 1944.",1
75,Appellant excepted and gave notice of appeal.,1
75,"However, the state correctly contends that the court was not bound to set aside the conviction upon a showing after the trial and after probation had been granted and revoked, that appellant was of juvenile age and not 17, as he represented to the court at his trial.",1
75,The facts upon which the trial court revoked appellant’s probation are shown by his admission that the allegations of the motion to revoke were true.,1
75,"One of these allegations was that he was arrested on April 6, 1961, by the police and charged with breaking into a beer truck and stealing 12 cases of beer.",1
75,Whether this violation was committed before or after probation was granted is not shown.,1
75,It is only shown that he was arrested for such during the term of his probation.,1
75,The other allegation which appellant admitted was that he had paid no part of his court costs as instructed by the court.,1
75,The order revoking probation is reversed and remanded.,1
75,The 1958 Chevrolet automobile owned by Gordon L. Shirley was parked and locked by the owner at the Bruce Courts in Odessa.,1
75,About 2:10 A.M. appellant was seen by Officer Fillyaw about a block and a half from the Bruce Courts.,1
75,"He was with another man, and they were carrying some clothes.",1
75,"The investigation which followed the report of the breaking and entry of the automobile led the officers to the Colder Hotel in Odessa, where the room of appellant was pointed out.",1
75,"A warrant of arrest was issued, and officers again went to the hotel and waited until appellant returned.",1
75,He was arrested and consented to the search of his room.,1
75,The trench coat missing from the automobile was found in the closet of appellant’s room.,1
75,In a pocket of the coat was found the personal check book of Mr. Shirley.,1
75,"Police Captain James Johnson testified that he first saw appellant at the Colder Hotel between five and six o’clock in the afternoon, and talked with him, and that with his permission he entered appellant’s room, searched it and found the trench coat and check book which were introduced in evidence.",1
75,"On cross-examination, Captain Johnson testified that he went to the Colder Hotel about 2:00 P.M., talked to the manager and found out appellant lived there and returned to the station; that about 5:00 P.M., after detective Fred Johnson filed on appellant and a warrant of arrest was issued, he went back and parked across the street, where he waited for over an hour.",1
75,Captain Johnson denied that he went in appellant’s room the first time he went to the hotel.,1
75,"The trial court properly overruled appellant’s request that the evidence relating to the search be discarded because he was under arrest and, therefore, incapable of giving his permission for a search of his home.",1
75,"After the State rested, Captain Johnson was recalled by appellant’s counsel and testified that he did not learn that a top coat was in the closet by him or his companion going into appellant’s room during his absence.",1
75,"Appellant then called William B. Jackson, who assisted in the management of the Golder Hotel, who testified that he designated to the officers the room of appellant, and that Captain Johnson walked in and opened the closet door and looked in the closet and said, “There is a gabardine coat.”",1
75,"Following the testimony of Mr. Jackson, appellant’s counsel moved for an instructed verdict “based upon the evidence produced in court that an illegal search was made of the defendant’s room without his consent and prior to the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, and without a search warrant.”",1
75,The motion was overruled and exception was reserved.,1
75,The fruits of the search were admitted in evidence without any valid objection being leveled thereto.,1
75,"In developing his own defense, appellant called a witness who attempted to raise an issue as to the legality of the search.",1
75,"Only after this evidence was produced was appellant heard to complain and that by means of an instructed verdict, which was clearly improper.",1
75,"If Mr. Jackson’s testimony did raise an issue as to the legality of the search, the issue should have been submitted to the jury, as appellant requested.",1
75,"However, it does not appear that exception was reserved to the court’s failure to submit the issue.",1
75,"The trial court instructed the jury to disregard the statement, but overruled appellant’s motion that a mistrial be declared.",1
75,The failure of the trial court to declare a mistrial does not call for reversal.,1
75,Officer Bevel testified that he observed the appellant driving an automobile along a public highway in Hale County.,1
75,"After the appellant stopped the car, Officer Bevel asked him for his driver’s license and appellant said he had none.",1
75,"At this time, Officer Bevel saw several cases of beer in the car.",1
75,"Upon a search, fifteen cases of beer were found in the car.",1
75,"Testifying in his own behalf, the appellant admitted that he was driving the car, and that two of the cases of beer in the car belonged to him which he had purchased for his own consumption.",1
75,Massoletti’s case was not one involving a charge similar to the case at bar.,1
75,He further stated that the other cases belonged to his two companions and that the pistol found in the car belonged to one of them.,1
75,"The jury, under the charge, resolved the issue of whether the appellant had the beer for his own consumption against him.",1
75,No brief has been filed on behalf of the appellant.,1
75,"On the night of New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1960, appellant and a companion, George Sullivan, went to the liquor store shortly before 10 P.M., to purchase some liquor.",1
75,"While they were in the store, a shot was fired and the two ran outside and fled.",1
75,Appellant was carrying two bottles of whisky.,1
75,"After the shot was fired, the deceased staggered from the counter and fell mortally wounded with a gunshot in the neck.",1
75,"The deceased’s wife, who was present, upon hearing the shot observed a gun in the appellant’s hand and identified appellant the next day at a police lineup as the one who shot her husband.",1
75,"She stated that just before the shot was fired, Sullivan tried to pull her from the doorway where she was standing into the store.",1
75,"Appellant was arrested on the night of the killing, around 1:55 A.M., and on the afternoon of January 2, accompanied the officers to his home where they recovered a .38 caliber pistol from a trash can, which appellant admitted was the pistol with which he shot the deceased.",1
75,Ballistics tests showed that a bullet recovered from the body of the deceased had been fired from the appellant’s pistol.,1
75,"Later in the afternoon of January 2 appellant, after being duly warned, made and signed a written confession to Officer D.",1
75,"Testifying as a witness in his own behalf, appellant admitted going to the liquor store on the night in question, but denied that he went inside and shot the deceased.",1
75,Appellant stated in substance that it was Sullivan who entered the store and shot the deceased.,1
75,He also repudiated his two confessions and testified that the statement in the confessions that he killed the deceased was not true.,1
75,Appellant swore that the reason he made such statement to the officers was to take the “rap” because of Sullivan’s bad record.,1
75,He further testified that the reason he signed the statement of April 21 was because a lieutenant at the police station told him if he would sign the statement the court would be more lenient with him and he would not get the chair.,1
75,"Clark, who was present at the time it was made, denied making any such statement or promises to appellant.",1
75,"The record reflects that appellant first called Sullivan as a witness and the State objected, on the ground that: “He is under indictment in this case and is not a competent witness.”",1
75,The objection was sustained.,1
75,"Thereupon, the jury was retired and in their absence appellant offered in evidence a certified copy of an indictment which charged Sullivan as an accessory after the fact to the offense of murder for which appellant was on trial.",1
75,"Later in the trial, State’s counsel announced: “At this time we will withdraw our objection to Mr. Knight calling George Sullivan to testify,” to which appellant objected on the ground that the State was challenging him to call the witness which he was barred from calling and moved for a mistrial.",1
75,The court instructed the jury not to consider the remark of State’s counsel and denied the motion for mistrial.,1
75,The punishment was the same as imposed in this case.,1
75,"After appellant’s counsel in his jury argument had inferred that the maximum punishment which Sullivan could receive was two years, State’s counsel made the following objection: “We object to that.",1
75,Appellant objected to counsel’s remark and moved for a mistrial.,1
75,They were running up and down the hall and kicked on several of the doors.,1
75,The contention is overruled.,1
75,Appellant cites no authority in support of his contention.,1
75,The evidence shows that appellant shot the injured party who was her husband.,1
75,"The court in his charge submitted such defense, but refused appellant’s request that the jury be instructed that in determining the existence of real or apparent danger it was the duty of the jury to “consider the words, acts and conduct, if any, of the injured party, at the time of and prior to the time of the assault and consider whatever threats, if any, the injured party may have made to the defendant * *",1
75,"Appellant testified that the injured party had threatened to kill her and had, shortly before she went to the scene of the shooting with a pistol, put a gun in her stomach and told her not to be causing trouble or he would shoot her.",1
75,"When asked why she took the gun with her to the scene of the shooting, she testified: “Other than being afraid of him I don’t know.",1
75,"He had threatened you many times, had he not?",1
75,"And beaten you up many times, had he not?",1
75,"She testified that when she walked up he had a gun in his left hand pocket, and he reached in and pulled it out “and he says T think I told you back up the highway not to start causing me no damn trouble’ and that when he pulled the gun out, I pulled the one I had out.”",1
75,She testified that when she took the gun out of her purse she was afraid he was going to kill her; that a number of shots were fired and that she did not know who fired first.,1
75,"Nowhere in the court’s charge do we find any reference to threats, and the charge on the right to defend against apparent as well as real danger did not encompass the threats or the words, acts or conduct of the injured party.",1
75,"So it was — threats that made you decide that you were going to kill him, is that right?",1
75,"No, I never had in my mind to kill anybody at any time.",1
75,* * * I took the gun with me because I was scared of him.,1
75,Was he pointing it at you?,1
75,He did point it at me.,1
75,And he told me to get the hell away from there.,1
75,He said T told you out the highway you weren’t going to cause me no trouble.’ ”,1
75,"In the same suit he has on now, or approximately the same suit.”",1
75,"In the statement of facts, it was stipulated that appellant had the care, custody, management and control of four or five 4/5ths bottles of assorted alcoholic spirits and three cases of 12-ounce bottles of beer in a dry area.",1
75,The permit offered in evidence was not a defense to the charge of possessing intoxicating liquor in a dry area for the purpose of sale.,1
75,"Trial of this cause was had August 22, 1961.",1
75,"The officers proceeded to make a forced entry into the apartment, at which time appellant and his companions ran toward the rear of the house.",1
75,Engle and Linda ran into the bathroom and appellant was apprehended in the kitchen.,1
75,Appellant had some needle marks on the inside of his left elbow.,1
75,"As the officers entered the bathroom, Engle was pushing the syringe in the commode and flushing the commode.",1
75,A piece of bloody rag was recovered from the commode.,1
75,"In the search of the apartment, the officers found a rubber bulb and eye dropper in a lady’s overnight case in the kitchen.",1
75,Inside the bulb and eye dropper was a brownish fluid.,1
75,A bottle containing a brownish liquid was found in a kitchen cabinet.,1
75,A plastic container and two hypodermic needles were also found on top of the kitchen cabinet.,1
75,"A chemical analysis run upon the contents of the rubber bulb and the bottle revealed that the bulb contained thirty milligrams of morphine and the bottle contained twelve milligrams of morphine, a narcotic drug.",1
75,The court submitted the issue of appellant’s guilt to the jury upon a charge on the law of principals.,1
75,"Appellant requested a charge on circumstantial evidence which was by the court refused, with exception noted by appellant.",1
75,"Objection was made to the charge on the ground that such instruction was not given, which objection was by the court overruled, with exception noted by appellant.",1
75,There is an entire absence of any direct evidence that he did possess it.,1
75,"The record shows that, in proving the enhancement allegations of the indictment, the state was permitted by the court to introduce in evidence before the jury the indictment in the second prior alleged conviction, which contained an enhancement allegation of another prior conviction.",1
75,“But a charge upon circumstantial evidence is required only where the evidence of the main facts essential to guilt is purely and entirely circumstantial.,1
75,"The question was restated, as follows:",1
75,Relator sought and obtained the issuance of writ of habeas corpus from this Court following his arrest upon capias pro fine issued to enforce the judgment of the County Court.,1
75,"If there is a valid law under which a complaint could have been drawn for the act charged, any irregularity or defect of commission or omission which would render the pleading voidable and not void would not entitle the defendant to relief by habeas corpus.",1
75,"The above testimony was that of Mrs. Rowell, the manager of the hotel.",1
75,"Trial was at the July-October, 1961, term of the court upon appellant’s plea of guilty to the indictment and waiver of a trial by jury.",1
75,On such date imposition of sentence was suspended by the court and appellant was placed upon probation upon certain terms and conditions.,1
75,"The state, with the agreement of appellant, introduced in evidence certain testimony given by a witness, C.",1
75,"J. Auten, before the grand jury of Jefferson County and in an injunction proceeding against appellant and also the testimony of one Walter Sekaly which was given at the injunction hearing.",1
75,"The testimony of the witness Auten reflects that he was an employee of the Department of Public Safety in the Intelligence Section and that during the months of October, November and December, 1960, while working undercover in Beaumont, he made various bets on horse races and football games at the Texas Club.",1
75,At such time a man was present who had been identified to him as William Sekaly.,1
75,"The witness Walter Sekaly, in his testimony given at the injunction hearing, testified that on numerous occasions, prior to December 3, 1960, he had seen William Sekaly accept bets on horse races and football games at the Texas Club in Beaumont.",1
75,The record contains no formal or informal bills of exception and no brief had been filed on behalf of appellant.,1
75,The evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error is shown.,1
75,"The State’s evidence is undisputed that appellant came into the drive-in grocery store where Ellis Dodson, the complaining witness, was working, on September 4, 1960; that the store belonged to Dodson’s son; that appellant ordered a cold drink; that at this time there were other persons in the store and the other persons left and appellant said, ""Give me another of the same”; that Dodson went to the icebox or refrigerator to get the cold drink and when he turned around he saw appellant standing by him pointing a gun at him; that while pointing the gun at him appellant told Dodson to give him his purse; that at this time appellant’s gun was pointed at Dodson’s body; that Dodson was in fear of losing his life or of suffering serious injury at the hand of the appellant; that Dodson gave appellant his personal money, about $146.00, out of his purse and appellant put the money in his pocket; that appellant said, “Let’s go to the cash register”; that when Dodson got to the cash register appellant said, “Open it up”; that appellant said, “Give me the money,”",1
75,Dodson further testified that before being shot he had done everything that appellant had ordered and directed; that Dodson had not made any move whatsoever to resist appellant; that during the scuffle Dodson bit appellant on the side of the neck and brought blood; that several people came up after appellant had run off; that an ambulance took Dodson to Baylor Hospital where he stayed a total of 42 days; that Dodson is still under a doctor’s care; that Dodson saw appellant two and one-half months later at a line-up at City Hall.,1
75,"D. Goodson, a mechanic, testifying for the State, stated that he went in a store on Colonial and saw appellant and Dodson tussling over a gun; that he ran out of the store; that Dodson came out of the store and said, “Somebody help me”; that appellant ran out of the store with the gun and shot Dodson three times, while standing about eight feet from him; that Dodson went to the ground; that appellant threw the gun down and ran; that Goodson called the police.",1
75,"The victim of the murder, Ruby Bickmore, and her common-law husband, Earl Sheldon Bickmore, were guests of the Cypress Hotel.",1
75,"Jerry Don Byrom, City of Dallas police officer, testifying for the State, stated that he got a radio message to go to 4919 Colonial; that he saw Dodson on the floor; that he called an ambulance; that Dodson gave him a description of the person who had robbed him; that he recovered two guns at or near the scene.",1
75,"Roosevelt Eubanks, testifying for the State, related that he knows appellant; that appellant was living with him on September 4, 1960; that he last saw appellant on that date between 9:00 and 9:15; that about twenty minutes later police came and he gave them permission to search his house.",1
75,"State’s witness B. L. Senkel, testifying for the State, stated that he was a detective in homicide and robbery, City of Dallas Police Department; that he saw a .22 caliber gun which had five empty cartridges and one loaded cartridge in the cylinder; that the loaded cartridge had a firing pin mark on it; that there were two loaded cartridges and four empty cartridges in the other gun; that he went to where appellant was staying with Eubanks; that he first saw appellant on January 16, 1961, in Portland, Oregon, in jail where appellant was booked under the name of Ricky Crestón; that he returned appellant to Dallas.",1
75,"The State adduced testimony from Dr. Ross L. Curtis, Jr., to the effect that he was a licensed and qualified physician with a specialty in general surgery; that he saw Dodson on September 4, 1960, in the emergency room at Baylor Hospital; that Dodson was “considered to be very critical; even almost to the point of death”; that Dodson was suffering from gun shot wounds; that Dodson remained in very critical condition for about one week and that Dodson is still under his care.",1
75,"City of Dallas police officer E. R. Beck, as a State’s witness, testified that he went to the Eubanks residence where appellant was living and found appellant’s pants and shirt under the bed in his room and that the shirt had blood on the left side by the collar.",1
75,The appellant did not testify in his own behalf.,1
75,"The only testimony adduced by appellant was from his mother, Lillie Mae Dunson, and his aunt, Mattie Lee Nelson, in support of his defense of insanity.",1
75,"The mother stated that appellant was 19 years of age, born on June 15, 1941; that appellant was not of sound mind, that he got hit on the head while in high school and that he had been acting strangely ever since in that he would burst out in laughter and sit in the middle of the floor and play with toys and that his head was hurting him a lot.",1
75,The careful and able trial judge fully submitted appropriate issues of insanity and all other issues raised by the evidence.,1
75,No exceptions or objections were taken to the court’s charge.,1
75,The punishment assessed is within the limits prescribed by statute.,1
75,"The taking of the money, the robbery, was completed before the second firearm or gun came into being in the cause.",1
75,The voluminous record containing a statement of facts of 615 pages shows a merciless killing of the deceased.,1
75,"“The murder of the victim, Ruby Bickmore, took place at a cheap rooming place or hotel.",1
75,* * * * It was called the Cypress Hotel but was commonly known as the “Greenhouse”.,1
75,* * * * It appears that the Appellant Barton was among the guests residing at the Cypress Hotel.,1
75,The Appellant Blevins was not a resident at the hotel but visited there frequently.,1
75,"On the evening of the 23rd of June, 1960, at about 10:00 p.m., Ruby and her husband, the Appellants, Mrs. Mary K. Rowell, the manager of the hotel, and her husband, Lloyd Edwin Rowell, and several other guests were present at the hotel.",1
75,It appears that all parties present were doing considerable drinking.,1
75,"After Earl and Ruby Bickmore had retired to their room, the Appellants were heard and seen running up and down the hall in their underclothes.",1
75,The room into which Ruby was carried was that occupied by Blevins and Barton.,1
75,"During the time that the Appellants were administering the fatal beating to Ruby Bickmore, they were laughing and cussing and using vile language.",1
75,“They used a pretty vulgar word.,1
75,And that is when they picked her up and carried her into their room.”,1
75,“Mr. Blevins said: T am going to take you into my room and I am going to have an intercourse with you.’ ”,1
75,"After about fifteen minutes, the witness Mary Rowell testified “I could hear them laughing and carrying on over there, and I went back and sat down.",1
75,"Mrs. Rowell testified that she did not have a telephone in her office, that the only telephone was in the hall, and that Mr. Blevins had said that if anyone tried to call the police out there, he would kill them.",1
75,"The Appellants left the premises the next morning, and Ruby Bickmore remained on the bed in her room all day long.",1
75,"Her husband was lying on the bed there with her, getting up only to go to the bathroom during that day.",1
75,The Bickmores also stayed in the bed during the following night.,1
75,"On the next morning, the victim was still lying in bed, which was in a filthy condition, and blood was running from her nose.",1
75,"At that time, an ambulance and the police were called, and Ruby Bickmore was removed to Jefferson Davis Hospital where she later died on the 25th of June, 1960.",1
75,"Appellants did not testify upon the main trial but presented testimony in support of their defense that someone other than themselves, either Earl Bickmore or Lloyd Rowell, had inflicted physical violence upon the deceased and was responsible for her death.",1
75,The court submitted to the jury the issue of appellants’ guilt of both murder with and without malice and of aggravated assault.,1
75,The court further instructed the jury on the law of principals and submitted the defensive issue of whether the deceased’s death was caused by acts of the appellants.,1
75,There are no formal bills of exception or objections to the court’s charge and no brief has been filed on behalf of appellants.,1
75,Upon objection by the State that the same was hearsay the court refused to admit such testimony before the jury.,1
75,"The statement made by the deceased was not shown to have been made in presence of the appellants, was clearly hearsay, and the court did not err in sustaining the State’s objection thereto.",1
75,Appellants sought a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence and alleged in the motion that subsequent to the trial they had discovered evidence that the door leading into the room occupied by the deceased and her husband at the hotel was never damaged which was contrary to the testimony of the State’s witnesses that on the night in question the appellants entered the room by kicking and breaking the door panel.,1
75,The city ordinance under which this conviction rests was not introduced in evidence or made a part of the record.,1
75,"In Texas, the state courts do not take judicial notice of the existence of city ordinances or their terms, and where they enter into a transaction and are relied on, proof of them is essential.",1
75,"The complaint alleged that the offense was committed on or about the 4th day of May, 1961.",1
75,"The information based on the complaint alleged that the offense was committed on or about the 4th day of March, 1961.",1
75,"Officers Harper and Kirkpatrick of the Dallas police testified that they were on routine patrol on the night in question, that they stopped an automobile for making an unusually loud noise, that appellant was the driver, that they asked to see his driver’s license, that as appellant was fumbling through a folder in search of the driver’s license they asked him to step out of the automobile, that they searched appellant and found he was carrying a .38 caliber pistol in his waistband and a blackjack in his hip pocket.",1
75,"Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he was employed as a cook by Wyatt cafeterias, that he worked four or five nights a week as a dance hall supervisor, that he was also employed by the Stone Rock Detective Agency, that on the night of his arrest he had been working at a dance hall and also investigating a divorce case, and that he did not know he was violating the law and had no intention of violating the law.",1
75,"George Dowdy, captain of police, called by the state in rebuttal, testified that he was in charge of the Dallas Police Depart",1
75,"D. Asbill, a Dallas police officer, called by the state on rebuttal, testified that he was assigned to the special service bureau of the police department, that his department approved applications of dance hall supervisors but that such approval does not give the applicant any police power or authority to carry firearms.",1
75,The sole questions presented on appeal are the refusal of the court to permit appellant to testify that upon being employed by the detective agency the assistant supervisor told him he could carry firearms in “the line of work” and the refusal of the court to instruct the jury that if appellant believed he had a right to carry the pistol to acquit.,1
75,"We have examined the authorities cited, and it it apparent from the opinion in each of them that the person who made the attempted appointment which led the accused to believe he had authority to act was in fact a de jure officer.",1
75,"In such cases, the accused became a de facto officer because his appointment was defective for some reason.",1
75,"Relator, by petition for writ of habeas corpus, seeks his release from custody of the sheriff of Hidalgo County, who holds him under a certain writ issued out of the 92nd Judicial District Court of Hidalgo County, after revocation of probation, commanding that he be delivered to the director of the Texas Department of Corrections.",1
75,"On May 7, 1962, relator’s petition was ordered filed and set for submission on the question of whether the writ should issue.",1
75,The sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction under an indictment cannot be raised collaterally by habeas corpus but must be raised by appeal.,1
75,"The record reflects that the affidavit was introduced in evidence by the state at the trial, and, as to relator, is inculpatory.",1
75,"Relator’s claim of suppression of facts by the prosecution is denied under oath by the Honorable R. L. Lattimore, Criminal District Attorney of Hidalgo County, and the Assistant Criminal District Attorney, Honorable Roberto Ornelas, in their affidavits which are before this court.",1
75,"Their denial of suppression is also supported by the affidavit of Honorable Arthur Gallucei, the attorney who represented relator upon the trial.",1
75,"The conviction is for assault with intent to murder without malice; the punishment, three years.",1
75,The appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction on the ground that there is no evidence that he had the intent to kill the injured party.,1
75,"The injured party, Willie Anderson, testified that appellant’s step-mother called to him from across the street to come and take her husband to the hospital.",1
75,"When he got inside the trailer house, the appellant had a butcher knife in his hand and was trying to stab his father, whom he had down on the bed, and his father’s hand was bleeding.",1
75,The injured party grabbed the appellant and pulled him out of the trailer.,1
75,"He then told the appellant, who still had the knife in his hand, that he ought to be ashamed of jumping on his father; that as he turned to walk away the appellant cut him with the butcher knife, and he held his stomach with his hands as he walked a short distance for help and then was taken to a hospital.",1
75,"Mrs. Anderson, the wife of the injured party, testified that after her husband took the appellant from the trailer house the appellant cut Anderson as he turned to walk away, and then appellant ran from the scene.",1
75,"Officer Chumley testified that when he arrived at the scene the appellant handed him a butcher knife and said to him, “I’ve gone and messed up.",1
75,"In appellant’s written statement made to Sheriff Cumbie,",1
75,"The testimony of a physician who examined the injured party at the hospital shows that he suffered an incision two inches long and through the abdominal wall which cut the colon and caused a small length of the intestine to protrude; that the wound was serious, and two surgical operations were performed; that he remained in the hospital for one month and three days, and was under medical treatment about ten weeks; and that the knife exhibited to him at the trial was capable of causing death.",1
75,"Testifying in his own behalf, the appellant stated that he and his wife had an argument and scuffle in the trailer house; and that she was using a beer bottle and he grabbed the knife to keep her from getting it; then his father intervened, but that he did not try to stab his father or have him down at anytime.",1
75,"He denied that the injured party ever came into the trailer house, that he had had trouble with Anderson the previous day, and that Anderson had threatened to whip him.",1
75,"After appellant had walked out of the trailer house, Anderson came and he told Anderson to leave him alone; then Anderson said wait until he returned, and not knowing what Anderson was going to do he tapped him on the shoulder and talked to him, and Anderson grabbed his stomach and he ran; that “I guess I” cut him as he was scared of Anderson, and that he told the officer “I think I have cut a man.”",1
75,"The testimony of appellant’s wife, his father and stepmother, and another witness corroborated the testimony of the appellant.",1
75,The state’s evidence consists of the testimony of Vice Squad Officer D.,1
75,"He testified that he went to the Brazos Hotel about 8:30 P.M. under assignment to make an undercover investigation in regard to alleged prostitution; that he registered under a false name; that appellant brought ice and seven-ups he had ordered to his room, at which time he asked appellant if he had a prostitute he could send to the room and said he wanted a date with one.",1
75,Appellant said he would get one for him and left the room.,1
75,"About 15 minutes later Virginia Mitchell, the female named in the complaint and information, came to the room and solicited Hadley for a $20 prostitution date.",1
75,Some 5 minutes later Virginia called for a porter and appellant came back to the room.,1
75,"Virginia told him that Hadley wanted another girl to come up, and appellant “said he would have another one right up there”.",1
75,Three to five minutes later Mary Ann Keith arrived and solicited Hadley for a $25 date for sexual intercourse.,1
75,"Hadley then called for appellant to send up “some setups”, and when appellant returned to the room Hadley identified himself to appellant and the two girls and placed them under arrest.",1
75,Was there anything else?,1
75,Sentence was duly pronounced in accordance with the jury’s verdict and judgment entered thereon by the court.,1
75,"This is an appeal from an order entered in a habeas corpus proceeding by the Judge of the 142nd Judicial District Court of Midland County, remanding appellant to custody for extradition to the State of Nebraska.",1
75,"The executive warrant issued by the Governor of Texas, directing the arrest of Marcilino N. Brito and his delivery to the agent of the State of Nebraska for return to that state, was introduced in evidence.",1
75,"Being regular on its face, the warrant made out a prima facie case authorizing the remand of appellant to custody for extradition.",1
75,The executive warrant and other papers introduced in evidence show that appellant stands charged in the State of Nebraska with the crime of failure to support minor children.,1
75,"On the contrary, the record shows that appellant, although duly served with citation, had filed no answer in the cause and no order for support had been entered by the court.",1
75,"Tommy Box, a 13 year old boy, and his father, Brady Box, were employees at the Luce Oil Company Service Station at the intersection of Little York and Aldine-Westfield Road.",1
75,"Joseph Paul LaMier, a customer of the service station for some ten years and who had been acquainted with Brady Box and Tommy Box for some eight or ten weeks, drove into the service station about 8:30 P.M. to get some gas.",1
75,When no one came out to wait on him he entered the service station and found,1
75,Tommy Box died several days later from gunshot wounds in the head and neck.,1
75,"Officers investigating the shooting went to appellant’s home where he delivered to them a .22 caliber automatic rifle, saying, “this is the gun you are looking for.”",1
75,"A number of fired shells or hulls found on the floor at the service station, and some leaden bullets found in the body of Tommy Box and Brady Box, were compared with test shells and bullets fired from the .22 caliber rifle, and the ballistic expert identified some of the recovered empty shells or hulls and bullets as having been fired from said rifle.",1
75,"Appellant’s confession was introduced in evidence without objection, in which he related how Brady Box had purchased his house, paying $70.00 in cash and giving him a check for $30.00 which was returned unpaid, and his difficulty in collecting from Brady Box thereafter and continuing:",1
75,“I was just trying to get my money from him and he would not pay me.,1
75,He was about two months behind and had a third one coming up.,1
75,He talked to the fmetmce company and they talked about taking the house away from me and signing it over to him.,1
75,About three weeks ago I filed eviction notice on him to move and nothing has happened about this.,1
75,"About two weeks ago I ask— him if he had received any eviction papers, he said, no I have not heard anything about any papers.",1
75,I had heard from people that he was telling them that they was going to take the house away from me and,1
75,"“I had some tickets that I had let a few people have credit when I had the station and I took these tickets today, April 26, and went to try to",1
75,Appellant offered no witnesses and his counsel did not cross-examine any of the witnesses for the state.,1
75,The question was raised for the first time on appeal.,1
75,This question was raised for the first time on appeal.,1
75,"The State’s proof shows that on June 7, 1961, appellant came into the Gill Grocery store in Wichita Falls, purchased $27.58 worth of groceries and paid for the same by endorsing the check described in the indictment.",1
75,"After receiving $71.17 in change, appellant left but never returned for the groceries.",1
75,"Solon R. Featherston, upon being called as a witness by the State, testified that the signature on the check in question was not his signature and that he had not given the appellant his consent or permission to sign the same.",1
75,"On June 8, 1961, following his arrest, appellant, after being duly warned, voluntarily gave a written specimen of his handwriting.",1
75,"Elmer N. Martin, supervisor of the questioned document section at the Texas Department of Public Safety Laboratory whose qualification as a handwriting expert was shown, testified that he made an analysis and comparison of the appellant’s specimen of handwriting and the handwriting on the check in question and expressed the opinion that the person who wrote the check was one and the same person who gave the handwriting specimen.",1
75,The copy served upon appellant was a true copy of the original except the three blank lines in the lower left hand corner of the original were not shown on the copy and the words “Value received and charge to account of________with exchange” in the original indictment were transcribed in the copy “Value register and check to account of________with exchange”.,1
75,"“Indeed, the authorities teach that an instrument, without any drawee named, is the subject of forgery, and it need not be shown in the indictment by explanatory averments on whom it was intended that the instrument was drawn.”",1
75,Evidence adduced upon the trial below is before this Court by an agreed statement of facts in narrative form.,1
75,"J. Karalis, of the Houston Police Department, testified that on the night of November 5, 1980, while on routine patrol, he stopped at the Rose Kitchen, located in the City of Houston ; that he observed appellant “staggering” in his walk and upon engaging appellant in conversation, noticed that he talked with a “thick tongue”; that appellant’s breath smelled of alcohol; that in his opinion appellant was at such time drunk; that he placed appellant under arrest and a search of his person revealed a .38 caliber “snub nose” revolver in his trouser pocket.",1
75,"Appellant, testifying as a witness in his own behalf, stated that the pistol had been stored at a friend’s house for some two months prior to his arrest; that on the night in question, he picked up the pistol and was on his way home when he noticed a woman acquaintance in a tavern which he passed; that he went inside and was drinking a coke when arrested.",1
75,"He further stated that he didn’t display the pistol to anyone, but kept it concealed in his pocket.",1
75,An examination of the record reveals that no objection was lodged by appellant which would raise the question of legality of the arrest.,1
75,"Relator stands charged by indictment in the 136th Judicial District Court of Jefferson County with having falsely sworn to an affidavit which was required by the Election Code as to all gifts and loans received and payments made by him in behalf of his candidacy for the nomination for the office of sheriff of Jefferson County at the first primary election held on May 7,1960.",1
75,"By original application for writ of habeas corpus brought in this Court, relator prays for discharge from confinement by the constable of Jefferson County, who holds him by virtue of a commitment issued after the return of the indictment.",1
75,The State’s evidence shows that appellant was stopped and arrested around 2 A.M. by Officer Don Garrison after he had clocked appellant driving his automobile at a speed of 80 miles per hour on the Pan American Expressway in the city of San Antonio.,1
75,"Officer Garrison testified that after he stopped appellant, he could smell a strong odor of alcohol on his breath; that his speech was slightly confused; that his walk was “swaying” and expressed his opinion that appellant was intoxicated.",1
75,He further stated that after appellant had consented to take a drunkometer test he took appellant to the police station where the test was administered to him by Detective Norman Jarke.,1
75,Officer William Donald Howe corroborated Officer Garrison in his description of appellant’s actions and appearance at the scene and expressed his opinion that appellant was intoxicated.,1
75,"It was stipulated that if Officer Jarke were called as a witness, he would testify that he gave appellant the drunkometer test in the usual and customary manner and that as a result of the test there were 280 cubic centimeters of water displaced.",1
75,Officer Jarke was later called as a witness by the State and described in detail the drunkometer test which he administered to appellant.,1
75,"Officer Harold Fisk, assigned to the police laboratory, testified that a drunkometer test which resulted in the displacement of 280 cubic centimeters of water indicated that the blood alcohol content of the person who took the test was .19% and that such percentage was indicative that the person was under the influence of alcohol.",1
75,"As a witness in his own behalf, appellant testified that he was employed at a brewery and on the day and night in question had worked from 4 P.M. until 1:30 A.M. Appellant admitted that he had consumed six or seven glasses of beer under company rules before getting off work but denied that he was intoxicated.",1
75,Appellant called several employees of the brewery who observed him at work on the night in question and who expressed their opinion that at such time he was sober.,1
75,Appellant did not pass the test and there is no showing of bad faith on the part of the officer.,1
75,"Officer Fisk testified that he had had over two years of chemistry at St. Mary’s University, had attended a short course at Northwestern University studying operation of the Harger Drunkometer and had supervision of the operators of the machine at the San Antonio Police Department.",1
75,"The record reflects that when the stipulation was made, Officer Jarke was absent from the court because of his duties in civil defense activities during the Storm Carla on the Texas Coast.",1
75,It was not until after appellant had later objected to the introduction in evidence of a photograph of a drunkometer machine that the officer was called to the stand to identify the photograph.,1
75,His testimony before the jury was not contrary to that which it had been stipulated his testimony would be.,1
75,Officer Jarke testified that the photograph was a fair and accurate representation of a Harger Drunkometer and identical to the one used in the police department.,1
75,The order of the judge who tried the case at the former trial shows that appellant’s counsel agreed to the discharge of the jury.,1
75,Appellant testified that he did not consent to the discharge of the jury.,1
75,"Two attorneys representing appellant testified that they never agreed, but objected, to the discharge.",1
75,"It was further shown by the record that the court inquired of the jury for the first time at approximately 10:15 P.M. on Saturday, October 8, 1960, what their sentiments were at arriving at a verdict and that the foreman replied: “Your Honor, we are deadlocked 11 to 1; we have been deadlocked 11 to 1 for several hours.",1
75,I see no possible chance of this jury reaching a verdict.”,1
75,The Court: “How do the rest of you feel about it?”,1
75,A juror: “I don’t see how we will ever get a verdict.”,1
75,A juror: “I don’t think so.”,1
75,The Court: “All of you hold up your right hand that feel that way about it.”,1
75,All but one held up their hands.,1
75,"The record further reflects that the jury retired for its deliberations about 7:00 P.M. on October 7,1960, and that they were discharged by the court over twenty-six hours later.",1
75,"Frank Longoria testified that he was a juror during the trial; that they deliberated for approximately four hours on October 7; that on October 8 they deliberated between three and four hours in the morning and from four to four and one-half hours in the afternoon, and three hours in the evening, a total of fourteen to fifteen and one-half hours of deliberation, not counting time for meals or sleep; that the jury found the appellant guilty within two hours; that most of the jurors were for a high penalty; that he was for five or ten years, or possibly more; that the others were too high; that all the time the discussion was on punishment except for the first two hours; that they were still far apart; that he did not say anything when the judge asked if they thought a verdict could be reached.",1
75,There is no statement of facts on the merits in the record.,1
75,"In Massoletti, the evidence reflected that whisky and vodka were found in the appellant’s automobile.",1
75,It is evident from the record that the jury deliberated approximately twice as long as they heard evidence.,1
75,They deliberated from twelve to thirteen hours on the matter of punishment alone.,1
75,The one juror who did not raise his hand and who did not say he could agree on a verdict testified that the others were too high.,1
75,At the former trial Judge Tillman Smith presided.,1
75,No jury had been empaneled.,1
75,"Evidence was then introduced before Judge Todd, transcript of which is before us, at the conclusion of which the plea of former jeopardy was overruled.",1
75,"Thereafter, on May 23, 1961, a plea of former jeopardy which appears to be otherwise identical with that upon which the court had heard the evidence and had overruled, was sworn to and filed, and was denied.",1
75,"On the same day, May 23, 1961, appellant filed a motion renewing his plea of former jeopardy and requesting that the court permit evidence on the plea of former jeopardy and have the jury pass on that question before hearing any evidence in connection with the offense charged in the indictment.",1
75,He alleged in said motion that any testimony taken in connection with the offense charged in the indictment would have a prejudicial effect upon the jury in considering the plea; and that to permit the jury to hear evidence in connection with the offense charged in the indictment at the same time that evidence was heard on the plea of former jeopardy would violate appellant’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial hearing and to due process.,1
75,"Although the exercise of this discretion is subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless a clear abuse is shown.",1
75,"Chief Deputy Sheriff Raymond Spraberry testified, without objection, that he observed the appellant driving a pickup on a public highway in the City of Hamlin, in Jones County; that the pickup was weaving to one side and then the other; that he stopped appellant shortly after 10 o’clock P.M., observed him; talked with him and, from his conversation and actions, formed the opinion that appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.",1
75,"The arresting officer also testified that he found some 19 bottles of beer in the pickup driven by appellant, and from his breath and actions he assumed that appellant drank the 5 bottles of beer missing from the 24 bottles case.",1
75,"A sample of blood taken from appellant at the hospital, shortly after his arrest, was shown to have been analyzed and found to have an alcohol content of 0.15 percent, and there was testimony that a person with that amount of alcohol in his blood is intoxicated.",1
75,"Records of the Driver and Vehicle Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety showing the issuance of a license to “Morris Sheppard Jean who is described as a white male, gray eyes, brown hair, 175 pounds, 5 feet 11 inches tall, born on June 7, 1912, and whose address is listed as Route 3, Hamlin, Texas” were introduced without objection.",1
75,The number of such license corresponds with the number of the license which the arresting officer found on appellant’s person.,1
75,"The complaint, information and judgment in said numbered cause, in the County Court of Parker County, were introduced.",1
75,The jury had the opportunity to observe appellant and determine by comparison with the description in the record whether he was the same Morris S. Jean as the person previously convicted.,1
75,The appellant was known in the community where he was tried.,1
75,He called witnesses who saw him on the night in question and testified that they saw no evidence of his being intoxicated.,1
75,"Artie Vaughn testified that about 11 A.M., June 13, she went to Juanita Evans’ house trailer to see if Evans’ daughter, the prosecutrix, could come to her house and spend the night.",1
75,"She called out the prosecutrix’ name several times, but there was no answer so she went around to the front of appellant’s house and continued calling for the prosecutrix- In about 15 minutes, the appellant’s front door opened and the prosecutrix came out, picked up the mail, and went back inside.",1
75,"She saw the appellant standing behind the prosecutrix when the door opened, but he shut it as soon as she came out.",1
75,"Shortly after this, Vaughn went around to the side of appellant’s house, and from there she saw the prosecutrix “standing under a big tree with her hands between her legs”.",1
75,"A physician testified that he examined the prosecutrix on June 17, and that his examination “revealed a hemorrhagic vagina; that means a vagina that on the inside was very red, and suggestive to me of irritation from some external source.”",1
75,"His examination also revealed a purulent discharge from the vagina caused, most likely, by a gonococchi infection, that the hymen was not intact, and that the vagina would admit his small finger.",1
75,"He further testified that his diagnosis was probably traumatic vaginitis, which meant inflammation or injury to the vagina.",1
75,"When recalled by the appellant, the physician testified that his examination of the vagina did not reveal any tear, and that he would expect some type of tear if penetrated by a normal size male; that he found no seminal discharge in the vagina, but that he made no chemical or microscopic test to determine such finding.",1
75,"Testifying in his own behalf, the appellant stated that Juanita Evans and her four children had lived for more than a year in a trailer house at the back of his home on the same lot.",1
75,"He further testified that Juanita and her children had been in his home daily, and he had helped raise the prosecutrix and the other Evans children, and had aided them all he could.",1
75,Appellant denied any act of misconduct by him to the prosecutrix.,1
75,He admitted that he had been in the penitentiary on at least three separate convictions.,1
75,"I was in the trailer house and he called me, out there in the back yard.",1
75,And where did you go if any place?,1
75,Out there in the back yard.,1
75,Where did he call you to come?,1
75,Did you go in the house?,1
75,"“Q. Tell us what happened in the house,",1
75,He pulled off his pants and laid on me.,1
75,He pulled off his pants in myself.,1
75,The State’s proof shows that on the night in question two automobiles were involved in a major accident at the corner of Field and Ross Avenue in the City of Dallas.,1
75,"Upon being advised of the collision, Officer Edgar L. Smith, Jr., and his partner proceeded to the scene around 12:15 A.M. When they arrived, appellant was seated on the front seat of one of the automobiles on the passenger’s side.",1
75,Officer Smith testified that after he arrived and was informed by someone at the scene that appellant had a pistol in his possession he went to the automobile in which appellant was seated and proceeded to search his person for a weapon.,1
75,The officer stated that in the search he found under appellant’s coat on the inside of the lapel a .38 caliber Colt loaded snub nose pistol which he took from him.,1
75,No objection was made by appellant to Officer Smith’s description of the search and to the introduction of the pistol in evidence.,1
75,"She started to have pains, cramping and became sort of “dizzy-like”.",1
75,"Testifying as a witness in his own behalf, appellant denied that he was carrying the pistól on the night in question.",1
75,The record contains no formal bills of exception and there are no objections to the court’s charge.,1
75,"Furthermore, the court instructed the jury not to consider the argument.",1
75,"Deputy Sheriff J. W. Ratliff testified that on the night in question while on patrol duty with his partner, Jack Middleton, they met an automobile being driven by appellant on Little York Road which was weaving back and forth across the road and that they proceeded to turn around and stop the appellant.",1
75,Deputy Ratliff testified that after stopping the appellant they found a six pack of beer in the back seat of his automobile and three bottles or cans of beer in the front seat which were partially empty.,1
75,He further stated that at such time appellant had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath; that he was unsteady on his feet and that in his opinion appellant was at the time intoxicated.,1
75,"Deputy Sheriff Middleton and Officer Wheatly, who was riding with the two deputies on the night in question, were called as witnesses by the State and corroborated the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Ratliff in his description of appellant’s actions and appearance and expressed their opinion that appellant was intoxicated.",1
75,"Testifying as a witness in his own behalf, appellant denied that he was drunk on the night in question and stated that he had consumed only one beer.",1
75,He further testified that he had been taking medicine which caused him to become drowsy.,1
75,"Witnesses were called by appellant, including two women passengers in the car with him, who testified in support of his contention that he was not intoxicated.",1
75,The jury chose to accept the testimony of the State’s witnesses and to reject that of appellant and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict.,1
75,“Question: State whether or not anything was stated about this being the third or second offense of Mr. Fain.,1
75,"There was bound to be, while it was never brought out it was not permissible — any previous offense of a person — there was naturally a certain amount of supposition there, and you yourself (appellant’s counsel) kept bringing out in the trial that it was very important that he not be found guilty because there would be the possibility that he would lose his driver’s license.",1
75,"“So naturally, the Jury was led to believe that he had been a previous offender.",1
75,We didn’t know one way or the other.,1
75,That was for us to determine.,1
75,That was just one of the points we based our judgment on.,1
75,“Q: And was there evidence introduced in the trial that • this man had committed some traffic offense before?,1
75,"“A: As I recall, the officer said that immediately after apprehending Mr. Fain, he had made the statement that he didn’t want to get another ticket or something to that effect.",1
75,"I will ask you whether or not there was any consideration of anything else other than that, any discussion ■ of anything like that, in the Jury Room?",1
75,The offense report appears in the record.,1
75,"Relator is confined in the penitentiary under sentence of 2 to 30 years on his plea of guilty before the court in 1958, to an indictment alleging assault with intent to murder with malice by laying in wait.",1
75,Officers were called to investigate a burglary of a Vine Street drug store in Tyler early in the morning of November 9.,1
75,One of them answering the call found deceased’s automobile parked on a side street near the Vine Street store.,1
75,"In it, he found blood and a woman’s black scarf.",1
75,"The operator of a nightwatching service in the city passed through this same side street shortly before midnight, or thereafter, and observed appellant standing by the side of a 1956 black Oldsmobile bearing license number RF 9234 and observed appellant’s co-principal Joan Brock seated therein.",1
75,"Because of the suspicious nature of the circumstances, he jotted down the make, year and license number of the automobile and transmitted such information to the officers.",1
75,"Two ambulance drivers observed a 1956 black Oldsmobile parked back of their funeral home property in another part of the city about midnight on the night in question, became suspicious, shone their lights thereon, and were informed by appellant’s co-principal that they were looking for their victim (who lived in a nearby apartment house).",1
75,Both she and appellant were identified.,1
75,"She was dressed in tight black trousers, black upper garment, and black scarf over her head.",1
75,"It was shown that the Vine Street drug store’s supply of narcotics and barbiturates was missing when the store was opened for business on the morning of November 9, and a number of items were identified at the trial by the person who had placed the store’s code thereon.",1
75,"It was shown that appellant’s wife was granted permission to park appellant’s Oldsmobile in a carport at an address other than the one where she and appellant lived in the city of San Antonio, and it was discovered at such address by the San Antonio police and Tyler peace officers on the same day.",1
75,"Immediately in front of the 1956 Oldsmobile, license number RF 9234, which appellant’s wife had placed in the carport, in an elevated storage cabinet, a box containing a quantity of narcotics and barbiturates was found and identified at the trial as having come from the Tyler drug store owned in part by the deceased.",1
75,Appellant and his co-principal were arrested at appellant’s home in San Antonio by virtue of a warrant and were returned to Tyler.,1
75,"State’s witness Joan Brock, upon being returned from the Department of Corrections where she was serving a life sentence for this offense, gave at the trial this version of the events connected with this homicide.",1
75,"She stated that in the course of plying her trade as a prostitute, she became acquainted professionally with the deceased, that he later took her to his drug store where he delivered certain narcotics to be sold by her in Houston, and an even division of the proceeds of the sale to be effected.",1
75,"Some time later, while in San Antonio, she spoke to appellant about the possibilities of securing money and narcotics from deceased.",1
75,He agreed to accompany her and gave her a pawn ticket and some money with which she reclaimed a pistol from a pawn shop.,1
75,"En route to Tyler, she called their victim and told him she was on the way, instructing him to meet her at the drug store after closing time in order that they might consummate further narcotic transactions.",1
75,"When they arrived in Tyler, they were unable to find their victim or his automobile and went to his apartment in their search, at which time she was questioned by two ambulance drivers.",1
75,"They later saw their victim’s automobile in front of the Vine Street store; they parked in a side street, and she entered the store alone, asked their victim if he had “the stuff” for her, and when he replied that he had some she “threw down on him” with her pistol.",1
75,"When he approached her, he was instructed by appellant, who was by that time inside the store and behind their victim, to “freeze”.",1
75,"When their victim turned toward appellant, she struck him in the head with her pistol, causing him to fall bleeding.",1
75,"While appellant held a pistol on their victim, she rifled the narcotics box and the cash register.",1
75,"She left the store with the narcotics, and appellant followed with their victim, with his hands bound behind him.",1
75,They drove their victim’s car to the side street and transferred to appellant’s automobile.,1
75,"Appellant borrowed her scarf in order to wipe off his fingerprints, and she learned much later that he had left it in their victim’s automobile.",1
75,"They then drove away from Tyler, and en route their victim freed his hands and assaulted her, whereupon she struck him several times on the head with the pistol she was carrying, causing him",1
75,"Appellant did not testify, but called one witness who proposed to testify as to some declaration made to him by appellant concerning a contemplated trip to Tyler and offered in evidence Joan Brock’s confession made to the assistant district attorney at Tyler shortly after her arrest.",1
75,"The confession tracks her testimony concerning the entire transaction, except that she says therein she bought the gun in San Antonio and fails to mention that appellant furnished the money and that it was his pistol which had been pawned, and she attempts to exonerate appellant by stating that she told him she was going to Tyler to fill a prostitution date and would share the proceeds with him.",1
75,"In that statement, she relates that she alone entered the drug store and that she drove their victim to the side street where appellant was waiting.",1
75,The next day she was too ill to attend school and stayed home.,1
75,She recounted in such statement that from that point forward appellant acted under her direction and because she was threatening him with her pistol.,1
75,"He further introduced into evidence a handwritten note written by Joan while in the Tyler jail and smuggled to him in a magazine, which recites the text of the confession she had given the district attorney, together with certain personal remarks of no probative value.",1
75,Appellant’s one bill of exception incorporates all his informal bills.,1
75,"At the hearing, the State called the mother of the deceased, who testified that she left her eleven months old child in the care of appellant and that when she returned she found her child lying lifeless on a sofa, that she carried him to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.",1
75,The Harris County medical examiner testified that his examination revealed the cause of death as being a fractured skull.,1
75,"Appellant’s confession recites that the child began to cry after he was left alone with it and that he tried to “keep him quiet” by spanking him and striking him on the head with a high top work shoe, after which he picked him up and threw him on the bed, causing his head to hit the bed post.",1
75,It was developed that appellant was free on a bail bond to answer to a charge of robbery at the time in question and that his bondsmen thereafter surrendered him.,1
75,"Appellant sought to raise an issue as to the voluntary nature of his confession by calling his sister, who stated that she saw appellant before he was placed in jail and later saw him in jail and noticed that his eyes and face were “swollen”.",1
75,There is no showing as to whether this was before or after the confession was made or that the “swollen” condition of his face was the result of any externally applied force.,1
75,"The front of appellant’s car struck Robert Lee Phillips, breaking his leg and thumb.",1
75,"The record contains four purported formal bills of exception which were filed on August 18, 1961, some 92 days after notice of appeal was given on May 18, 1961.",1
75,"They cannot be considered by this Court as they were filed after the 90 days provided in Article 760d, V.A.C.C.P.",1
75,The prognosis and the doctor’s opinion as to disability and the testimony as to shortening of the leg and a limp border closely on being a part of pain and suffering.,1
75,"“Q. Dr. Cullen, in your opinion will Bobby Phillips suffer disability as a result of that broken leg?",1
75,"“Mr. Friloux: Your Honor, I don’t think that is a proper question.",1
75,"“The Court: Gentlemen, in this case the injuries were less than death.",1
75,That is all you have to prove.,1
75,"Filer: Your Honor, I think it is material.",1
75,I think the State has a right to explain what the injuries were.,1
75,“The Court: He said he had a broken leg.,1
75,"Filer: Well, Your Honor, I think the State can show what the outcome of the broken leg is.",1
75,"“Mr. Friloux: Your Honor, I can’t see the relevancy of this.",1
75,He’s proved without any question as to whether or not the boy was hurt by a motor vehicle.,1
75,We will stipulate that he had a broken leg.,1
75,“The Court: What is the next question?,1
75,Filer: What is that disability is the next question.,1
75,My first question was in his opinion did this boy suffer disabilities as a result of this broken leg.,1
75,I think the boy would have some disability.,1
75,Filer: No further questions.,1
75,"“It is provable that one accused of drunken driving had a collision on the highway with an automobile driven by another person, on the ground that the manner in which accused",1
75,"“We have been unable to see in what way the details of the injuries sustained by Mrs. Ripley and the resulting pain and suffering and probable continuance thereof shed any light upon the question of whether appellant was intoxicated, and if objection thereto had segregated this part from the evidence which was admissible a most serious question would have been presented.”",1
75,“The admissibility of like testimony was upheld by this Court in Allen v.,1
75,"State, 197 S.W. 2d 1013, upon the theory that proof thereof was pertinent upon the issue of intoxication.”",1
75,"When Officers Strickland and Rodgers announced at the front door of a house that they were police officers and had a search warrant for the house, they heard scuffling and movements inside, immediately entered, and saw the appellant run into the bath room.",1
75,Strickland and Rodgers pursued the appellant into the bath room where they saw him throw a package into the commode and flush it.,1
75,"Rodgers pulled the appellant away, and Strickland retrieved the package from the commode.",1
75,"While testifying, both Officers identified the appellant and the package which they testified he threw into the commode.",1
75,"The package, which contained six blue cellophane papers with a white powder in each of them, was introduced in evidence.",1
75,An analysis by a chemist of the substance in each of the cellophane papers showed that it was 36.5% pure heroin.,1
75,"The appellant did not testify or offer any testimony, and no brief has been filed in his behalf.",1
75,An informal bill of exception shows that the trial court refused appellant’s request that he be shown an offense report made by Officers Strickland and Rodgers.,1
75,"The affidavit and warrant being valid, no error is shown in the admission of the results of the search.",1
75,"During the trial, appellant made no request of the trial court that the offense report be made available to him for the purpose of perfecting his bill of exception.",1
75,"After the conclusion of the trial, the State declined to approve the statement of facts as it was presented to them and moved the court to include the offense report in the statement of facts so that it might be inspected by this Court.",1
75,"The search warrant, if there was one, was not before the Court in Mapp.",1
75,The state’s testimony is undisputed and is reflected by various witnesses.,1
75,"Jo Ann Williams, the complaining witness, was a 19-year-old colored girl and a student at Jack Yates Senior High School- In July, 1960, not having menstruated since April, she went to see Dr. Phillips.",1
75,Dr. Phillips said that he examined Jo Ann Williams at that time and that in his opinion she was pregnant.,1
75,"She testified that she made an appointment to see the appellant on the 3rd of August, 1960.",1
75,"Jo Ann Williams further testified that prior to August 3, 1960, she had felt life in the baby she was carrying in her womb.",1
75,She said' that the last time she felt life of the baby was when she left the office of the appellant.,1
75,"She related that while the appellant was working with her she “felt the quivering for about twenty minutes and then in the last part of the twenty minutes, a sort of tight knot came in my stomach and after that I didn’t feel anything else.”",1
75,"Jo Ann attended school the next day, finished her classes at about 12:00 o’clock and went straight home.",1
75,"That day she started having labor pains, and she testified that her “water broke” in a “gush”.",1
75,"At this time, she called her sister for assistance, and a short time thereafter a small baby was born.",1
75,"She was then placed in bed awaiting an ambulance, which was called and later arrived and took her to the hospital.",1
75,"At the Hermann Hospital where she was taken, she was treated by Dr. H.",1
75,"Dr. Leon Phillips testified that he was a licensed physician and surgeon in Houston, Harris County, Texas, and stated that he had examined the complaining witness and that in his professional opinion she was over two months pregnant at the time he examined her on July 8, 1960.",1
75,"Dr. Homer B. Woodward, Jr., testified that he was a medical doctor and a resident in obstetrics and gynecology at Hermann Hospital, and that he examined the complaining witness, Jo Ann",1
75,"Harold W. Rodgers, a police officer for the city of Houston, homicide division, in the company of policewoman Lanny Dixon went to Hermann Hospital on the 6th day of August, 1960, and as a result of their conversation with the complaining witness in this case went to 5002 Chenevert Street.",1
75,"They were admitted to the house upon the invitation of an attendant there, a Mr. Inman.",1
75,"Without objection, the officer testified that they searched the premises, where they found the instruments and utensils later introduced into evidence as State’s Exhibit Nos.",1
75,Nothing at all to connect those up and no proper predicate laid.”,1
75,The officer further testified that they found a large amount of medical instruments and material.,1
75,"The photographs taken by the officers were also introduced into evidence, without objection.",1
75,Appellant was present and upon the premises at the time the search was made and was placed under arrest at that time.,1
75,"Policewoman Lanny Dixon testified to the search of the premises where appellant lived, without objection, and corroborated the testimony of Officer Harold W. Rodgers in almost every respect.",1
75,"Gloria Coleman, a sister of the complaining witness, testified that she was living at the same address as the complaining witness and that during the period of time of July and August, 1960, up until the time the complaining witness’s child was born, she appeared to be pregnant.",1
75,"On August 5, 1960, she was called into the bathroom by the complaining witness and stated that",1
75,"Martha Marie Rubin testified that on the 3rd day of August, 1960, she went to “Dr. Veevers’ ” home with the complaining witness and that they were accompanied by Joyce Marie Woodard, who is now residing in California.",1
75,"A short time after they were admitted to the house, the appellant arrived and took them into a bedroom.",1
75,She said that he got some tools and a pan which were similar to those in State’s Exhibits Nos.,1
75,She said that Jo Ann lay across the bed and after Jo Ann had taken off her panties he took the catheter and appeared to be “pushing some kind of a liquor up inside of her”.,1
75,"She further testified that the appellant, after placing an instrument inside the complaining witness, appeared to be scraping around inside of her.",1
75,"After the appellant had performed his work, he asked for $75.00 in money and thereafter gave the complaining witness some small pills.",1
75,This witness was at Jo Ann’s house on the 5th of August and was present at the time the embryonic sac burst.,1
75,She saw the body of a child protruding from the body of the complaining witness prior to the time she was taken to the hospital.,1
75,"Appellant did not testify, offered no other testimony in his behalf, and rested with the State.",1
75,"There is a statement of facts with this record containing the jury argument of counsel, which will be more fully discussed hereafter.",1
75,There is also a statement of facts containing a transcript of the testimony on hearing the motion for new trial.,1
75,"The testimony upon the hearing of motion for new trial shows that appellant’s attorney requested the words “did then and there unlawfully, wilfully, and designedly” be inserted in the court’s charge and that upon his request these words were added to the charge given by the court prior to the court reading the charge to the jury.",1
75,"There are no formal bills of exception in the record, and the record contains no objections to the court’s charge and no specially requested charges of the appellant, other than has already been mentioned in the preceding paragraph.",1
75,"Under the record, it is shown that the statement was not a part of the res gestae.",1
75,Appellant in this case did not file a motion to quash the indictment for any reason.,1
75,No reversible error is shown.,1
75,The argument of the prosecutor in this case was merely that the life of the fetus had been destroyed.,1
75,Numerous informal bills of exception were reserved in the trial of the case.,1
75,"Dr. Phillips, a medical doctor, was asked to describe a catheter and asked whether or not such an instrument could be used in a manner calculated to cause an abortion.",1
75,"Dr. Woodward, a medical doctor, was asked a number of hypothetical questions to which the objection was made that a proper predicate had not been laid, and that the doctor’s answer would be an invasion of the province of the jury.",1
75,These objections were properly overruled.,1
75,"The predicate, if not fully laid at that time, was supplied by later testimony.",1
75,"Appellant gave the complaining witness the drugs at the same time that he performed the operation with instruments and, as such, it was res gestae of the offense charged.",1
75,It was also admissible to show the intent of appellant to perform the abortion.,1
75,* * * On October 14th of this year I went to a gun shop on South Ervay Street and bought a .32 revolver.,1
75,The failure to insert the word ‘unlawfully’ in the charging part of the indictment does not vitiate it.”,1
75,This information concludes with those words.,1
75,"“It is a case in which a female, whether wed or unwed, consenting to the act of an abortion, and for the filthy, measly price of $75.00 in money, in effect, squelch out, kill and murder some unborn child * * *",1
75,"“MR. KNIGHT: Just one minute, may it please the Court.",1
75,“THE COURT: That is sustained; the jury won’t consider it for any purpose whatsoever.,1
75,"“MR. KNIGHT: We move for a mistrial on the base of the inflammatory, prejudicial use of the word ‘murder’ in counsel’s argument.",1
75,"The information alleged that appellant had theretofore in Cause No. 149896, on the 17th day of February, 1960, been convicted of an offense of carrying a pistol.",1
75,"When the State came to prove such allegation, it called the identifying witness, who testified that the prior conviction was in Cause No. 149986.",1
75,"The judgment of conviction introduced in evidence shows such conviction to have been on the 17th day of February, 1961.",1
75,"The record reflects that while Officer Wagner was being questioned by the state’s counsel on his direct examination, the following transpired:",1
75,"The record clearly reflects that the statement was made by appellant after his arrest, in conversation with the arresting officer while he was being taken to jail from the scene of the arrest.",1
75,"State, cited in the majority opinion, the defendant stated that he knew he was drunk but wanted the officer to take him home.",1
75,"There Bill of Exception No. 2 complained that Knox, one of the arresting officers, was permitted to testify that he asked the defendant Garland if he had anything to drink, and Garland replied: “I have had a few social drinks.”",1
75,"Now, then, after the defendant was placed under arrest I believe you stated you drove his automobile to town, is that correct?",1
75,Did you have any conversation with the defendant at any time?,1
75,"“MR. BROWN: Your Honor, we object to any conversation that they had after he was placed under arrest.",1
75,“THE COURT: We will sustain that objection.,1
75,"(By Mr. Flynt) Mr. Wagner, I will ask you whether or not did the defendant make any voluntary statement to you after he was placed under arrest?",1
75,"“MR. BROWN: Yes, we object to any statement made by the defendant after he was placed under arrest.",1
75,“THE COURT: Overrule the objection.,1
75,"The way to town, first we talked of two main subjects.",1
75,Only thing you can testify to is any voluntary statement the defendant made.,1
75,"“MR. BROWN: May our objection go to all this testimony, any statement made after the defendant was arrested out there on the highway, any statement made by the defendant, voluntary, involuntary or force or otherwise.",1
75,"She testified that appellant came into the Brookshire store where she was employed and “asked me to cash a check”, that she instructed him to take it to Mr. Kinser, the manager, for his “O.",1
75,"Kinser testified that he observed certain irregularities in the check when appellant presented the same to him, that he called the police, and that appellant hurriedly left the store, leaving the check in his possession.",1
75,"Constable Dobbins testified that when he saw appellant on the day in question appellant ran, but that he apprehended him and carried him to Brookshire’s store.",1
75,"Appellant was identified, and the fact that the check was a forgery was established.",1
75,"“As to the omission of the words ‘Associate Store’ from the indictment, we quote from 37 C.J.S.",1
75,"“ ‘So the addition of words, letters, or figures which do not affect the sense will not vitiate the indictment; nor will the omission thereof.",1
75,Officers went to appellant’s premises with a search warrant and found 10 one-half pints of vodka 35 or 40 feet south of the back of his house and outside of his enclosure.,1
75,There was a trail from the house to an old abandoned cellar where this vodka was found.,1
75,"Three cases of beer and a broken case were found buried in an open field, two cases in one place and one in another.",1
75,An empty vodka bottle found in a trash can at the rear of the house had serial number 25208937.,1
75,"Serial numbers 25208929, 935 and 939 were among the numbers on the vodka above mentioned.",1
75,Across the road from appellant’s house and some 50 or 60 yards from his front door a case of Tom Moore Whisky and 24 half-pints of vodka were found in a hole.,1
75,"A trail was visible from the road to the liquor, but the yard was described as “hard packed” and “you could not see the trail until you got right across the ditch.”",1
75,46 half-pints of whisky and 24 half-pints of gin were found some 65 or 70 feet from appellant’s house and 15 to 20 yards from the road.,1
75,This was also across the road from appellant’s premises and the evidence shows that there was a trail that “leads from the road direct straight to the house and to the whisky and direct back to the house”.,1
75,"The whisky, vodka and beer was introduced in evidence and it was stipulated that the area was dry.",1
75,There was considerable testimony as to trails across appellant’s premises as well as adjoining land.,1
75,Orby Arthur as well as the appellant lived on appellant’s premises.,1
75,Both were present at the time of the search and there is no explanation as to Arthur’s presence or why he was not charged with possessing the liquor.,1
75,"We call attention to the fact that the record shows that Arthur’s trailer house, located some 75 yards from appellant’s house, was searched .and no intoxicants or evidence thereof were found and the record fails to reflect that any trails were found leading from such trailer",1
75,"The deceased, a 50 year old Latin American, 5 feet 6 inches in height and weighing 181 pounds, met his death in Houston shortly after 1:15 A.M. by being stabbed in the back.",1
75,"The wound was described by the Harris County Medical Examiner, whose qualifications as an expert were stipulated, as being a knife wound 1% inches in length and 2 inches in depth, the edges sharply demarcated.",1
75,"The witness testified that the wound penetrated the aorta, and that it was a wound such as could have been caused by the knife introduced in evidence.",1
75,"The evidence shows that the blood stained knife was taken from the pocket of a suit of clothes found in appellant’s room which appellant claimed, and which he was wearing at the trial.",1
75,The knife was described as having a sharp blade,1
75,"The deceased left the Sibony Night Club in company with the band leader and operator Ponce after closing time, which was 1:15 on Sunday morning.",1
75,When they got downstairs Ponce went to his car and he and his wife left for home.,1
75,Ponce testified that he never saw the deceased again and did not know what direction he went as they parted.,1
75,"The deceased also passed Vincent Lucio, his wife Isabella and his sister Mary Lou, who were at or near the corner where there was a bus stop.",1
75,I didn’t see them after that.”,1
75,"The appellant, according to the testimony of the Lucios, had come with them from the Pan-American Night Club where he and Mary Lou had been dancing and drinking.",1
75,"They were considering going to the Casa Blanca but appellant declined and Mary Lou, who had been walking behind with appellant, left him and joined her brother and sister-in-law and walked to the bus stop.",1
75,"When the deceased passed going in the direction where Mary Lou had left appellant, Mary Lou started to walk back.",1
75,"She testified that she called the appellant but he did not answer; that she got within three feet of the northwest corner of Henke-Pilot building and, as she returned to the bus stop, the deceased fell near the corner of the building, and that right after he fell she saw appellant pass the fire station.",1
75,"Captain Kent, of the Houston Fire Department, testified that after the deceased, known to him only as “Cheto”, passed the station and the bus stop going in the direction of the old Henke-Pillot building, Mary Lou followed behind him some 20 feet; that Cheto hollered “No, No” * * * “and there was a person chasing him.",1
75,And they chased him up to this building.,1
75,"The girl, then, headed back hastily toward the corner.",1
75,Cheto collapsed on the sidewalk.”,1
75,Captain Kent further testified that as Cheto was around behind the building “You could hear the thud of him being slammed on the building.,1
75,"* * * I heard a groan, as Cheto was slammed into the building * *",1
75,"Captain Kent called the police dispatcher and, as he stepped to the door: “I",1
75,"It was a matter of seconds, according to this witness, between the time Cheto fell and the time he saw appellant come around the corner.",1
75,He identified appellant at a police line up and at the trial as the person who came around the corner and passed the station.,1
75,"B. Jones, who was visiting at the fire station, followed the appellant, and Captain Kent and other firemen went to Cheto and found that he was dead.",1
75,"B. Jones gave testimony similar to that of Captain Kent, though neither heard the sound or groans described by Kent.",1
75,"According to all of these witnesses, there were no persons seen in the vicinity at the time the deceased was stabbed other than those above mentioned.",1
75,"Several assembled after the officers arrived, however.",1
75,Captain Kent testified that he was the first person to get to the body of Cheto and “there was no other person in the general vicinity whatsoever.”,1
75,Appellant did not testify or offer evidence in his behalf.,1
75,"Several days after the killing, - appellant was arrested by Officer Kennedy at the rooming house where he lived.",1
75,The officer testified that appellant consented to the search of his room.,1
75,"The trial court was careful to exclude testimony as to any statement or declaration of the appellant, but it is contended that the witness was permitted to testify as to acts of the appellant which were in the nature of a confession and might have been used by the state as a criminative fact against him.",1
75,The only act we find which could be said to come within the rule relied upon is the testimony of the witness to the effect that he asked the appellant what clothes he was wearing on the previous Saturday night (to which there was no objection).,1
75,The witness was then asked and answered: “Q.,1
75,Did he point out any clothes to you?”,1
75,"After this question and answer objection was made and overruled, but there was no motion to exclude the evidence.",1
75,"The witness then testified without further objection: “And what clothes did he point out to you, sir?”",1
75,He pointed out a charcoal colored suit.,1
75,The same suit that he is wearing now,1
75,"The state’s testimony reflects that Mrs. Mabel Cummings was the president of Urbana Sand and Gravel Company, the corporation being the owner of the store that was broken into without her consent.",1
75,Mrs. Cummings had actual custody of the building.,1
75,It was her testimony that the actual cash market value of the shotgun shells taken was $63.,1
75,"The state’s testimony, adduced from the two accomplice witnesses, Nations and Matthews, reflects that they did break into the store belonging to Mrs. Cummings and took therefrom numerous items, including shotgun shells and cigarettes.",1
75,"These two witnesses did, by their testimony, fully implicate appellant.",1
75,"It was shown by Nations’ testimony that he went with appellant to Houston, where appellant said he was going to sell the shells.",1
75,"Thomas L. Ford, a state’s witness, testified that he lived in Houston and operated a fish market; that he knew the appellant, had known him for three years.",1
75,"When asked if he had ever done business with appellant before, the witness Ford replied: “Only bought some rabbits from him.”",1
75,"This witness further related that appellant brought some shotgun shells and cigarettes to his place of business some time during August, 1961.",1
75,State’s counsel then inquired: Q.,1
75,"Take a look in that box there, Thomas.”",1
75,The record reflects that the witness complied.,1
75,“Can you identify those?”,1
75,"“As much as I saw of it, I did.",1
75,"I didn’t check on it, but I saw them.”",1
75,"“All right, Sheriff, I am going to ask you to examine those boxes of shells.”",1
75,“Have you ever seen those before?”,1
75,“Where did you see them?”,1
75,“In Chief Frazier’s office in the sheriff’s office in Houston.”,1
75,“You got these shells from the Harris County Sheriff’s office?”,1
75,The witness further related that the shells had been in his possession since that time.,1
75,The shells were then admitted into evidence and marked State’s Exhibit No. 1.,1
75,Ford’s testimony did not establish that appellant knew the shells were stolen.,1
75,"In fact, it indicated that such was not the case because appellant made no suggestion to Ford that he conceal the shells nor did he intimate to him that they had been stolen.",1
75,Ford made no effort to conceal the shells which were delivered to him even if they had been shown to be those which were stolen.,1
75,"While it is true that Mrs. Cummings did identify the shells as the ones taken from her store, she did not in anywise connect the appellant with the transaction.",1
75,Ford never positively identified the shells.,1
75,The four appellants are Negroes who were jointly charged with two members of the white race with intentionally aiding each other by purposely grouping at the entrance of the restaurant to illegally prevent the restaurateur from rightfully pursuing his occupation.,1
75,"D. Burleson, who had been the lessee from the railroad since 1954, was the owner and operator of a restaurant located in the Union Terminal Building in the City of Houston.",1
75,"The restaurant contains 6,000 square feet, with double doors opening into a passageway which leads to the lobby of the Union Station and another door facing on the railroad tracks, and food is served from 6 A.M. to 10 P.M. daily.",1
75,"Burleson testified that about 3 P.M. on February 27, 1961, when the appellants attempted to enter the door between the restaurant and the terminal lobby, he prevented them from entering by securely closing its doors.",1
75,"The arresting officer, while testifying, identified each of the appellants and said that they were just outside the double doors between the restaurant and the terminal lobby when he arrived about 7:30 P.M.; and also that there were 30 to 40 other persons at and near the door of the restaurant.",1
75,Appellant Graves was the only appellant to testify and no other evidence was offered in their behalf.,1
75,"The Appellant Graves testified that he and Appellant Jones, accompanied by two girls, went to the restaurant about 6 P.M.; that he had no intent and purpose of preventing Burleson from operating the restaurant, and that they were arrested about 8:30 P.M.",1
75,"The prosecutrix, age 15 when the trial began July 28, 1961, testified that about 18 months before the trial the appellant first came to her bed in the trailer, sat on the bed, pulled the cover back, removed the bottoms of her pajamas and placed his hands on her private parts.",1
75,"She asked him to quit and pushed him away, but he told her to be quiet which she did because she was afraid of him.",1
75,"The state’s evidence was to the effect that the appellant was observed by officers using binoculars who testified that they saw him get into an automobile with other occupants and go in a northeasterly direction from appellant’s house; that they watched appellant as he unloaded some boxes of alcoholic beverages; that iearly the next morning the officers found 12 quarts of wine and some beer at the place where they saw appellant unloading the beverages; that at the place where appellant was barbecuing hogs, the officers found a quart of wine and nearby a half-carton or 12 cans of beer.",1
75,The wine and beer was offered in evidence.,1
75,"The state’s evidence further shows that there was a trail leading from the house where appellant lived alone to where the wine and beer was found, a distance of some four or five hundred yards.",1
75,"The area was shown to be dry, and the prior convictions alleged were proved.",1
75,Is this beer here yours?,1
75,Is it your testimony that this carton was found where the wine was?,1
75,A. That’s what they were telling me when they got me down there and I told them I didn’t know nothing about that carton there.,1
75,The State’s evidence shows that appellant was manager of an apartment and rooming house in the city of Dallas.,1
75,"On the date alleged in the information, Detectives Johnston and Gee of the Dallas Police Department, Special Service Bureau, went to the address around 4 P.M. When they arrived, Officer Johnston went inside the house and Officer Gee remained outside.",1
75,"It was shown that the two women, Frances Cummings Bank-head and Delores Bobbett, had the general reputation of being common prostitutes and that the house in question had the general reputation for being a house of prostitution and assignation.",1
75,It was further shown that other women had been arrested at the house for being common prostitutes and that appellant had been advised by the officers.,1
75,Appellant had stated to the officers that she was manager of the house; that she would rent a room to anyone for a dollar and that she knew: “* * * that girls came to her house and rented rooms with their dates * *,1
75,Appellant did not testify or offer any evidence in her behalf.,1
75,Complaint is made to the court’s refusal of certain charges requested by appellant.,1
75,These two requested charges were evidentiary in nature and upon the weight of the evidence.,1
75,In refusing to give such charges the court did not err.,1
75,The testimony shows that the appellant and his wife slept in the house and their four children slept in a house-trailer adjacent to the house.,1
75,"The prosecutrix and her two younger brothers slept in the same room, with her bed nearest to the house, and her older sister slept in a separate room in the trailer.",1
75,"After lowering his pants and removing his privates, he got on top of her and placed his private parts into her private parts.",1
75,She told him that he was hurting her and after a short time he left.,1
75,"She further testified that after the first time he would come to her bed about once a week, although sometimes it would be less frequently, and everytime he came he did the same thing.",1
75,"The last time that he came was about the middle of May, 1961, when he did the same thing to her that he had done before.",1
75,"On further examination about what occurred on the night in the middle of May, she testified as follows:",1
75,"On cross-examination, the prosecutrix testified that on the night in May when the appellant put something inside her privates that it could have been his hand, but she did not know for sure.",1
75,"On recross-examination, she testified that when the appellant last came into the trailer in May she could not be sure what he put between her legs.",1
75,A physician testified that his examination of the prosecutrix about four weeks before the trial showed that the orifice of her sexual parts was large enough to receive the private parts of a male.,1
75,"On cross-examination, he testified that such enlarged condition could have been caused by the repeated use of the hand.",1
75,"The appellant’s written statement made May 22, 1961, and introduced in evidence by the state, recites in part:",1
75,For the last year I have been going out to the trailer * * *.,1
75,I would take her (prosecutrix’) pajama bottoms off and play with her sexual parts * * * .,1
75,Within the last week I was out ■ in the trailer with (prosecutrix) and I played with her sexual parts * * * .,1
75,I knew this is wrong and I knew it was wrong when I did it * * * .”,1
75,"It is observed that no motion for a new trial was filed, and the court in its charge to the jury did not mention the death penalty.",1
75,Did he have his private parts in you then?,1
75,Did he keep his private parts in yours very long that time?,1
75,How long would you say?,1
75,"Now when you say that * * * now you are talking about in May when he tried to put his private parts in your private parts again, is that right?",1
75,"And when you say he tried to, do you mean that he was not able to put his private parts in your private parts at all?",1
75,Do you think that he only put his private parts into you just a little way?,1
75,"But he did do that the last time he came in there, in the middle of May?",1
75,"The evidence shows that Dallas police officers, pursuant to a search warrant, entered an apartment in which appellant was present as a guest; that the apartment was rented by two girls, Billie Yvonne Coleman and Donnie Ray Stringfellow Ogle.",1
75,We shall not here relate further details other than to state that the officers did retrieve a vial from appellant containing what was later chemically established to be marijuana of sufficient quantity to make one large or two small cigarettes.,1
75,The state has ably briefed the question and has pointed out many authorities to sustain its position that these judgments were admissible.,1
75,"The following testimony was adduced by the state upon cross-examination of the witness, Billie Yvonne Coleman:",1
75,The court responded: “Yes.”,1
75,"This line of questioning continued as to several other offenses of vagrancy, the witness responding that she had not been convicted and had never pleaded guilty.",1
75,Officer Leavelle denied making any promises or threats to the appellant during the making of the statement.,1
75,"The appellant, while a witness in his own behalf, was then asked upon cross-examination if he had pleaded guilty of the offense of vagrancy, to-wit, associating with and receiving aid from known prostitutes, on several occasions in two different J. P. courts.",1
75,"Objections were taken, overruled, and the witness denied the prior convictions.",1
75,"The state then adduced testimony from the witness George Hamilton, the clerk of Justice of the Peace McBride’s court, over objections by the appellant.",1
75,"Evidence was then adduced by the state from the witness Mrs. Evelyn Smith, shown to be the clerk of Judge Glen Byrd’s court.",1
75,"Mrs. Smith was first asked about a judgment showing a conviction against a defendant by the name of Virgil John Etchieson, the question asked being: “And the offense?”",1
75,"The state then apparently attempted to introduce a slip or something to more specifically show the subsection of the vagrancy statute, for the state’s counsel stated: “We w,ish to offer this to show the subsection.”",1
75,Objection was then taken by appellant and sustained by the court.,1
75,"The state then made inquiry about two other judgments showing convictions for the offense of vagrancy, involving a defendant by the name of Billie Yvonne Coleman, and the witness responded that the judgment records disclosed convictions for the offense of vagrancy.",1
75,This witness also testified that she did not know either the appellant or Billie Yvonne Coleman.,1
75,At no other place in the entire testimony in its effort to impeach these witnesses did the state show any prior convictions for any offenses other than vagrancy.,1
75,"This statute states that “The following persons are and shall be punished as vagrants, viz. * * * ,” and then lists twenty-one (21) distinct categories or sections by way of classifying the persons amenable to this act, among them being persons known as tramps, persons leading an idle, immoral, or profligate life, who have no property to support them, and who are able to work and do not work; persons able to work who have no visible means of support; habitual loafers and loiterers, persons trading or bartering stolen property; every common gambler, gypsies, beggars, every common prostitute, every able-bodied person who lives without employment or labor, and who has no visible means of support.",1
75,"This statute then enumerates in the four subsequent sections additional acts involving prostitution and prostitutes, and defines “prostitution”.",1
75,"In the Steele case, the appellant had taken the stand in his own behalf and he was asked upon cross-examination if he had not been arrested and had not paid twenty-five or thirty fines within the last two years for vagrancy under assumed names.",1
75,"When the appellant denied that he had, an officer was then allowed to testify, over objection that the offenses inquired about did not involve moral turpitude, that he had arrested appellant or had been in company with others who arrested appellant on three or four occasions, and that he had pleaded guilty to vagrancy under an assumed name.",1
75,"He objected thereto on the grounds that he did not read it, and that it was signed under duress.",1
75,"“Q. Yvonne, I will ask you whether or not you are the same Billie Yvonne Coleman that was convicted in Cause No. 2268, in Judge Glen Byrd’s Court, on June 23, 1959, for the offense of vagrancy, to-wit, then and there being a common prostitute?",1
75,"No, I have never been in Glen Byrd’s Court.”",1
75,"Were you convicted in Cause No. 2268 on June 23rd of 1959, of being then and there a common prostitute for the offense of vagrancy?”",1
75,The witness replied: “No.”,1
75,"Are you the same Billie Yvonne Coleman that in Cause No. 2274 in Judge Glen Byrd’s Court, was convicted of the offense of vagrancy, to-wit, being then and there a common prostitute?”",1
75,"“Shall we just have a full bill to this, so that we won’t have to object to each question?”",1
75,"All right, the judgment shows a conviction for what offense?”",1
75,The answer was: “Vagrancy.”,1
75,"All right, does it show there which subsection of the vagrancy statutes Virgil John Etchieson was filed on for?",1
75,"All right, by looking at that can you tell what section of the vagrancy statute the case was filed under?",1
75,"You would have to look in the jacket, is that correct?",1
75,Does the judgment show a conviction on her?,1
75,And the offense please?,1
75,"“Examining the impeaching testimony of the officer in the matter now before us, it is not made to appear that the vagrancy to which appellant pleaded guilty, as asserted by the officer, could be admissible as impeaching testimony.”",1
75,"Grace Box testified that on October 14, while she was alone in the liquor store which she and her husband operated, the appellant, whom she identified while testifying, came in about 1:30 P.M.",1
75,"She showed him various merchandise, but he said the prices were too high, and when another person came in the appellant left saying he would return.",1
75,"As the second customer left, the appellant returned to make a purchase.",1
75,"When she started to place the merchandise in a sack, the appellant pointed a pistol toward her, saying for her to put all the money in the sack instead of the merchandise.",1
75,"She put approximately $1650 in money in the sack against her will and without her consent, because she was in fear of bodily injury and her life.",1
75,Then appellant ordered her into a room in the back.,1
75,"On October 30, the appellant was apprehended by the officers in Houston while carrying a loaded .32 revolver in the center of his back underneath his shirt and belt.",1
75,Shortly thereafter he was returned to Dallas.,1
75,The .32 revolver was introduced in evidence on the trial.,1
75,"The state introduced in evidence a written statement signed by the appellant on November 1, 1960, and it reads in part as follows:",1
75,"The appellant did not testify but recalled the state’s witness Grace Box who testified that shortly after the robbery she “picked out a man” in á police line-up, and that he was not the appellant.",1
75,"On further examination by the state, she identified the appellant as the person who robbed her.",1
75,She also testified that the gun introduced in evidence was “exactly like it” — the one used by appellant during the robbery.,1
75,No objection was made at the time the evidence was introduced showing the search and finding of the revolver on appellant’s person on the ground that it was an unlawful search.,1
75,Appellant complains of the introduction of his written statement in evidence.,1
75,"The testimony of Officer Leavelle shows that he gave the appellant the statutory warning before the appellant made the written statement to him, and that the appellant read the statement and then signed it.",1
75,"I paid $25.00 for this gun, then rode the Ervay bus to South Dallas, got off on Colonial and walked over to S. Lamar Street near Hatcher, I had planned to rob one of the liquor stores at this location.",1
75,I used to live in this part of town and knew the area pretty good and thought I could get away easier.,1
75,"When I got there I saw a woman in Pat’s Liquor Store by herself, so I decided to rob it.",1
75,I went in and there was a colored man in the store.,1
75,I left and came back and he was still there.,1
75,I think he bought a case of beer.,1
75,After he left I told the woman to give me a fifth of Ten High.,1
75,When she got the whisky I pulled the gun on her and told her to put the money in the sack and forget about the whisky.,1
75,"She put the money in the sack, then I locked her in the back room and left, walked over and caught the bus and rode back to town.",1
75,"Texas Highway Patrolman Hickman testified that, while on routine patrol at about 6:05 A.M. on the date in question, he observed appellant in front of Haley’s junk yard loading a tire and wheel into his car; that he stopped and questioned him; that appellant claimed he was employed at the junk yard and the tire and wheel belonged to him; that further investigation revealed that appellant had in his possession one Cadillac tire and wheel,",1
75,He further testified that at the time he observed appellant there were no other people in view and that he was unable to find any person on the scene or about the scene other than appellant.,1
75,"Roy Laughlin, deputy sheriff of Orange County, testified that he was called to the junk yard at about 6:30 A.M. on the date in question, that he saw appellant there with officer Hickman, that there was no one working at the junk yard and no one else in the immediate area at that time of the morning, and that he took possession of the tires, wheels, generators and starters.",1
75,"Both officer Hickman and officer Laughlin testified that, as a result of appellant’s later story that he had bought the merchandise in question from an employee of the junk yard just before officer Hickman arrived at the scene, they investigated all the employees of the junk yard but could not find anyone fitting the description given to them by appellant.",1
75,"Charles Haley, the owner and operator of the junk yard, testified that the tires, wheels, generators and starters in question belonged to him and that they had a value of $160.00.",1
75,"Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that on a previous occasion he had stopped at Haley’s junk yard to see about a carburetor, that a person named “Skeeter” sold him a radiator, that on the date of the alleged offense he was passing the junk yard and Skeeter beckoned for him to stop, that Skeeter had the tires, wheels, starters and generators and asked appellant if he could get rid of them, that Skeeter wanted $50.00 for the merchandise but appellant offered him $30.00 and they struck a bargain and Skeeter left, and that officer Hickman arrived on the scene as he was loading the merchandise he had bought from Skeeter.",1
75,He further testified that he told officers Hickman and Laughlin about buying the merchandise from the person called Skeeter and that he had voluntarily made a written statement concerning this transaction.,1
75,"At the close of appellant’s testimony, the State introduced into evidence the written statement he had made concerning the purchase of the merchandise.",1
75,"Appellant took the witness stand and testified substantially to the same facts contained in the statement, and he cannot now claim to have been injured by the introduction of the statement in evidence.",1
75,"In the case at bar, appellant testified substantially in accordance with his exculpatory statement and made no objections or requests regarding the court’s charge.",1

75,"After he found a small hole in the left side of the chest of the deceased, the appellant told Officer Wagner that she had shot him, and gave the officer a gun which had been recently fired containing one empty cartridge.",1
75,"He further testified that appellant told him that when she returned from taking the children to school her 16-year-old, afflicted daughter told her that the appellant had gotten in bed with her and had taken her panties off.",1
75,"She telephoned the deceased at his place of employment and, when he came home, they got in an argument and she shot him as he tried to take the gun away from her.",1
75,"When asked if she told him that the pistol went off accidentally, the officer replied: “No, sir; she said she shot him on purpose and intended to kill him.”",1
75,She called several witnesses who testified that her general reputation for truth and veracity and as being a peaceable and law abiding citizen was good.,1
75,"At the close of the evidence, the plea of guilty which had been entered by the appellant in the beginning of the trial was withdrawn by the court and a plea of not guilty was entered for her.",1
75,The disposition of this case on appeal is made solely on the basis of a plea of not guilty.,1
75,"After the refusal of her motion for an instructed verdict, the appellant, while testifying in her own behalf, gave her version of the killing.",1
75,"According to the testimony of Officer Wagner, when the appellant gave him the gun at the scene shortly after the killing, she told him that she shot the deceased “on purpose and intended to kill him”.",1
75,"Testifying as a witness in her own behalf, she admitted that she was mad at the deceased and was holding the gun on the deceased at the time he was shot in the chest, but that she did not intend to kill him.",1
75,"The court charged the jury on the law applicable to murder without malice, aggravated assault, and the suspension of sentence.",1
75,The jury are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.,1
75,They were authorized to accept or reject any or all of the testimony of the appellant.,1
75,"A prior appeal from the conviction to this Court was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, because no final judgment had been entered of record.",1
75,This is an appeal from the subsequent entry of judgment nunc pro tunc in the cause.,1
75,"The record reflects that the information was not presented by the prosecuting attorney but was in the form of an affidavit by the affiant, who signed the complaint.",1
75,"By agreement the case was tried jointly with two other felony charges against appellant, one for burglary and the other for felony theft, and the record shows that appellant was under a 10 year sentence when these cases were tried.",1
75,None of the sentences were cumulated.,1
75,"By agreement of appellant and his counsel, the state introduced in evidence the testimony of Laymon Matthews, the injured party named in the indictment, given at the examining trial, which includes the following.",1
75,Matthews lost his way and drove onto a dead end street shortly before midnight.,1
75,"Before he got back to the intersection his car stopped and, because the battery was dead, he was unable to start it, so he walked to the intersection where he encountered appellant and his two companions who asked him what was wrong.",1
75,"Matthews told them his car would not start, and appellant’s companion George Hermosillo, Jr., said they would give him a push if he would take them home.",1
75,"The four then went to the car and began to push, Matthews on the left at the open car door, appellant on the opposite side and his companions in the rear-Appellant and his companions were talking in Spanish, which Matthews did not understand.",1
75,Appellant then came around behind Matthews and put a knife in his back.,1
75,Matthews did not see the knife but testified that he knew “it was a small blade”.,1
75,"Matthews further testified that appellant struck him three times with the knife; stabbed him; pulled it out and hit again, and he (Matthews) ran to the intersection and appellant ran after him; “I ran so fast he stumbled.",1
75,I ran to a policeman.,1
75,"Matthews further testified that appellant stabbed him in the back and in his side, around his spleen, as a result of which he was taken to a hospital where an anesthetic was administered and where he remained for 8 days.",1
75,"Relator gave notice of appeal and filed an appeal bond which was approved by the Justice of the Peace, and a transcript of the proceedings and appeal bond were transmitted to the County Court at Law No. 2 of Bexar County.",1
75,"After notice to relator that the case was set for trial in the County Court on November 19, 1960, at 9:00 A.M., the appeal was dismissed at 9:05 A.M.",1
75,The proper action for the County Court to have taken would be to have entered an order forfeiting relator’s bond.,1
75,"Having concluded that the court erred in issuing the writ of procedendo, it naturally follows that jurisdiction is still in the County Court at Law No. 2 and the Justice Court had no authority to issue the capias pro fine.",1
75,"The arresting officer, Abilene Police Patrolman Dorrough, expressed the opinion that appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he stopped the pickup truck he was driving.",1
75,On cross-examination the officer testified that he had not known the appellant previously; had never seen him walk or heard him talk and did not know whether he had a speech impediment or whether the slurring of his words was a natural condition..,1
75,The bills were approved with the qualification that there were four people with the defendant at the time of his arrest and there were four witnesses sworn for the defendant in the presence of the jury at the trial and available to defendant.,1
75,"Now, tell this jury what physical factors that you base your opinion upon that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor?",1
75,"Number one, he was * * * when he first got out of his pickup, he staggered quite a bit.",1
75,He had to hold on to his pickup to walk to the back of it to keep from stumbling around.,1
75,His speech was very slurred.,1
75,His eyes were more or less glassy.,1
75,"When we first got him to the station, he was belligerent.",1
75,"He didn’t want to associate with us, or didn’t want to help us in any way.",1
75,"We had to just tell him everything, had to tell him several times.",1
75,The sufficiency of the evidence is not questioned.,1
75,"Including the testimony of the appellant, it shows that when arrested appellant was driving his automobile upon a public highway in Dallas with a metal City of Dallas danger marker or sign lying across the hood of the car.",1
75,"The sign was described as some 6 feet tall, including the post, the face of the sign being about three feet tall and around eight inches wide.",1
75,"The arresting officers, and a third officer who observed appellant after his arrest, expressed the opinion that appellant was intoxicated.",1
75,"They described his appearance and demeanor and the odor of alcohol about him, and testified to their experience, as the basis for their opinions.",1
75,On cross-examination the officer witnesses answered that they were acquainted with the fact that there are certain situations with reference to medicine and with reference to health that might cause a person to appear to be intoxicated when he is not.,1
75,"“Ladies and gentlemen of the Jury, don’t you know that if you were stopped and you knew you were taking pills and you knew you weren’t drunk and you were stopped by police officers and accused of drunk driving, wouldn’t you say ‘Officer, I have been taking pills, here they are.’ ”",1
75,There the complaint was that the state was allowed to introduce evidence showing that the defendant remained silent as to certain matters at the time he made a confession.,1
75,“We think the basis of this complaint is the failure to state all of appellant’s grounds of defense rather than a fact of silence when charged with such offense.”,1
75,"The State’s testimony shows that on the day in question, an automobile in which appellant and his two companions, Billy J. Matthews and William H. Vaughn, were traveling, collided with a Chevrolet automobile around 6 P.M. at the intersection of Westmoreland and Ledbetter streets in the city of Dallas.",1
75,In the collision appellant and his companions received certain serious injuries and four persons riding in the Chevrolet automobile were killed.,1
75,It was shown by the State’s testimony that prior to the collision appellant and his two companions had been together drinking.,1
75,They first met at the Manhattan Club around 4:30 P.M. at which time appellant had a pint bottle of Scotch whisky one-fourth full.,1
75,After he and Vaughn consumed the whisky they purchased a fifth of Ballentine Scotch Whisky which they opened and each mixed a drink.,1
75,The three then left the place and drove to Hall’s Drive In in appellant’s automobile.,1
75,Appellant drove the car.,1
75,While driving between the two places appellant and Vaughn finished their drinks.,1
75,At Hall’s Drive In appellant and Vaughn each mixed another drink which they consumed.,1
75,During all of the time Matthews was drinking beer.,1
75,"At 5:30 P.M. they left Hall’s Drive In and drove to Westmoreland Heights Shopping Center where Vaughn got out of the automobile, went into a store, cashed a check, and purchased some cigarettes.",1
75,He then returned to the automobile and got in the front seat with appellant and Matthews.,1
75,The proof shows that after the collision the two automobiles left the ground and came to rest on top of a 5% ft. embankment with the front of the appellant’s automobile embedded over % way into the right side of the Chevrolet.,1
75,The Chevrolet had moved 46 feet from the point of impact and there were skid marks 56 ft. in length in a southerly direction on Westmoreland Street.,1
75,In the collision appellant and two of the occupants of the Chevrolet automobile were thrown from the vehicles in which they were riding.,1
75,A partially empty bottle of Ballentine’s Scotch Whisky was found in appellant’s automobile.,1
75,"Accident Investigator Middleton, who went to the scene, testified without objection that in his opinion the appellant’s automobile was traveling south on Westmoreland and the Chevrolet automobile was traveling west on Ledbetter.",1
75,The officer testified that he could smell the odor of alcohol on appellant’s breath at the scene of the accident.,1
75,"He further testified that in a conversation with appellant later in the evening at the hospital, appellant told him that the car belonged to his wife and that he was driving it at the time of the collision.",1
75,As a witness in his own behalf appellant stated that because of certain head injuries which he sustained he did not remember the collision.,1
75,Appellant admitted that prior to the accident he had a drink of whisky and one beer but denied that he was intoxicated.,1
75,"Appellant stated that while he did not remember the collision, he was under the impression that Matthews was driving the automobile and denied that he was the driver.",1
75,Witnesses were called by appellant who testified that they had observed him prior to the collision on the afternoon in question and expressed the opinion that at such time he was not intoxicated.,1
75,"As heretofore shown, appellant denied that he was intoxicated and that he was the driver of the automobile at the time of the collision.",1
75,"“Now, therefore, I instruct you that if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant, Lloyd Madison Stewart, as charged in the indictment, in the County of Dallas, and the State of Texas, on or about the 17th day of December, 1960,",1
75,No attorney for appellant of record on appeal.,1
75,"On the day in question, the deceased, an acquaintance of the state’s witness, came to her apartment in the afternoon.",1
75,"After the deceased arrived, appellant telephoned the prosecuting witness for a date and upon being refused told her that he was coming after his pistol and a radio.",1
75,"Soon thereafter, appellant came to the apartment and after having a difficulty with the state’s witness and her brother over the pistol, left with the pistol around 4:30 P.M. While at the apartment, appellant was introduced to the deceased and when he left the prosecuting witness told him not to come back.",1
75,"After appellant departed, the state’s witness and the deceased left the apartment and returned around 11:30 P.M. When they returned, the deceased went to bed and the prosecuting witness, after undressing, came into the room and sat down on the foot of the bed.",1
75,"While the two were talking, appellant forced his way into the apartment, through the front door, fired two shots and then fled.",1
75,After the shots were fired the deceased ran out of the apartment and fell in the back yard with two bullet wounds in his body.,1
75,"Following his surrender to the sheriff, appellant accompanied the officers to an address where a .22 caliber pistol, with which he shot the deceased, was recovered.",1
75,"An autopsy performed upon the deceased’s body disclosed two bullet wounds, one in the neck and one in the left side of the back which passed through the aorta and was the cause of death.",1
75,"It was further shown that several weeks before the killing, the state’s witness had quit dating appellant and at that time appellant stated that if he ever saw her with anyone he would kill them.",1
75,"Testifying as a witness in his own behalf, appellant stated that he had been going with the state’s witness for some time and on occasions spent the night in her apartment.",1
75,"Appellant testified that on the day in question, he went to the apartment in the afternoon to get his radio and at such time he was introduced to the deceased.",1
75,Appellant denied having any trouble over the gun.,1
75,"Appellant testified that on the night in question, he returned to the apartment around 12:30 A.M., and entered by “jimmying” the lock which he had done on prior occasions.",1
75,Appellant further testified in support of his application for a suspended sentence that he had never been convicted of a felony and called certain character witnesses who attested to his good reputation.,1
75,The court instructed the jury in his charge on the law of both murder with and without malice and charged the jury on the appellant’s right of self defense against a deadly attack.,1
75,The issue of suspended sentence was also submitted to the jury in the charge.,1
75,No brief has been filed on behalf of appellant.,1
75,"Mrs. Moers testified that at midnight on the night in question she was awakened by an argument between two men which was taking place in the street in front of her house at 1619 Weber Street, that in a moment both men started running down the street and fell down, during which time blows were exchanged and following which one of the participants came up on her porch and fell.",1
75,"The police were notified, and deceased was found lying on Mrs. Moers’ porch dead from a stab wound in the heart.",1
75,"The testimony shows that appellant’s father was questioned soon thereafter, was found to have sustained injuries indicating that he had been in a fight, was taken into custody and admitted having engaged deceased in a fight on Johnson Street (at the",1
75,"Officer Kindred talked to appellant’s father in jail the next afternoon, and during the course of this interrogation appellant appeared at the homicide office and produced a knife which he stated he had been asked to bring.",1
75,"Kindred asked appellant if he wanted to make a written statement concerning his connection with the homicide, and appellant stated that he had tried to contact his lawyer, had been unable to do so and wanted to talk to his father.",1
75,"Such permission was granted, and thereafter appellant emerged and said, “I will tell you what happened.”",1
75,"His confession recites that he was sleeping in the front bedroom at 1520 Weber Street on the night in question, that he heard an argument between his father and the man who was later killed, that they both went around the corner onto Johnson Street, that he put on his pants and followed them and there found his father lying face down in the street.",1
75,"He recited that he then turned his attention to the man who was later killed and pursued him down Weber Street, where he cut him; that he returned to his home, where he found his father, and told him he had stabbed deceased; that his father told him to go to bed and if anything happened to say that he (his father) had inflicted the injury.",1
75,"The confession continues by reciting that he gave the knife which he had used to “Alice” and went to bed, that thereafter his mother informed him the police had carried his father to jail, that in the afternoon of the next day his father called him from the jail and told him to come to the police station and bring the knife, that he inquired of his mother where she had hidden the knife, retrieved the same and went to the station where he talked to his father who told him that the officers knew what had happened and suggested that he tell them the truth.",1
75,Anpellant did not testify or call any witnesses in his own behalf.,1
75,"No requested charges were submitted, and no objections were made to the charge as given.",1
75,"During the trial the district attorney, on cross-examination, asked appellant: “Have you ever been indicted for a felony?”",1
75,It was agreed and stipulated “that at the time the district attorney asked said question he knew that defendant was under certain indictments and had certified copies of such indictments; and that to his knowledge defendant had not been convicted of any felony.”,1
75,"The trial court sustained objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question, but overruled appellant’s motion for mistrial.",1
75,"“The fact that a defendant in a criminal case * * * is, or has been, charged by indictment * * * with the commission of an offense against the criminal laws of this state, of the United States, or any other state shall not be admissible in evidence on the trial of any criminal case for the purpose of impeaching any person as a witness unless on trial under such indictment * * * a final conviction has resulted, or a suspended sentence has been given and has not been set aside, or such person has been placed on probation and the period of probation has not expired.”",1
75,This is an appeal from the county court where appellant was assessed a punishment of six months’ confinement in jail and a fine of $500.00 for transporting an alcoholic beverage in a dry area.,1
75,An examination of the record discloses that it does not contain a judgment of conviction.,1
75,The prior convictions alleged were proved and admitted.,1
75,"Hill Hutson, who lived about 100 yards from a cedar post yard in Comal County, owned by Lem Calhoun and operated by Harden Wallace, saw two pickup trucks in the cedar yard about midnight.",1
75,"After the trucks were driven away, headed toward New Braunfels, he went to a neighbor’s home and reported to the sheriff’s office what he had seen.",1
75,"Deputy Roman Kneupper, in response to the call, went immediately to a road intersection and, together with other officers, stopped two pickup trucks loaded with cedar posts.",1
75,"He testified that appellant was driving one of the pickups, a black CMC truck, and George Anthony Angold was driving the other, a red Ford •pickup; that he asked Angold in appellant’s presence where he got the cedar posts, and “he said he just cut those cedar posts up near Boerne.”",1
75,Harden Wallace identified the cedar posts loaded on the pickup trucks as those missing from the cedar yard.,1
75,"He testified that he counted the posts on the pickup, and there was no difference in the number and size or the marks between them and the missing posts.",1
75,Appellant testified that he cut the cedar posts found on the pickup truck he was driving and was taking them to his mother in Austin.,1
75,It is apparent that the jury did not accept his testimony as true.,1
75,"Harden Wallace testified, without objection, that the 101 posts, which he described by size and gave the reasonable market value of each such size, had a reasonable market value of $64.19 at the time and place they were removed from the cedar yard, that being the price at which such posts were sold at the yard.",1
75,"Lem Calhoun testified that he owned three cedar yards, that the prices stated by Harden Wallace in his testimony were the selling prices for such posts in the three yards, and he considered such prices to be the reasonable market value on the day in .question.",1
75,"Roy Eugene Lee testified that about 1:30 A.M. on the night in question he and a companion were on their way to work and discovered a car in the ditch beside the road with the headlights on, the radio playing, the driver’s door locked, and the window on the driver’s side “bashed in”; that on the shoulder of the road there was a woman’s white shoe; that about ten feet further up the road there was another shoe and beyond this a woman’s bag; that he called the police, who reported to the scene and determined that the car belonged to a Mr. Moosberg.",1
75,"Mrs. Moosberg, the prosecutrix, testified that on the night of June 15, 1960, she had been visiting friends and was returning home alone in her automobile about 1:00 A.M.; that appellant drove his automobile up beside her, forcing her off the road; that she tried to back away but lost control and her automobile ended up crossways of the road; that she had the doors of her automobile locked and the windows up; that appellant approached the driver’s side and smashed his fist through the window; that she fled through the right hand door of the automobile and ran up the road, losing her shoes and purse; that she looked back and saw appellant pushing her car by hand from the roadway into a ten-foot deep ditch; that appellant got into his own automobile, overtook her, and forced her into his car; that he made her wipe blood from cuts on his right arm and hand; that he demanded",1
75,"She further testified that on July 16, 1960, one month later, she saw appellant at a drive-in restaurant, recognized him, and asked her husband to drive closer to appellant’s car, which was a different car than he had been driving on the night of the rape, and took down the license number; that her husband called the police, who arrested appellant; and that after viewing the freshly healed scars on his right hand and arm, which she had described to the police earlier as the ones she was forced to clean on the night of the rape, she reaffirmed her identification of appellant.",1
75,"Dr. Wharton, a duly licensed and qualified physician, testified that he examined Mrs. Moosberg in the early morning hours of June 16, 1960, and found “an abundant quantity of sperm in her vagina” and a bruise on the top right side of her hipbone.",1
75,"Dallas police officers testified that they removed prosecutrix’s automobile from the ditch and examined and photographed it; that they preserved blood drippings found on the shattered window, which were determined to be the same type as that of appellant; and that they removed a good identifiable fingerprint from the unshattered portion of the driver’s window which was later identified, after comparison, as that of appellant.",1
75,"The State offered into evidence, without objection, appellant’s confession to the offense.",1
75,He presents this matter by an informal bill of exception and contends that the jury had already seen the seat covers and the court’s instruction to disregard them could not cure the error.,1
75,"When the court’s attention was called to the fact that the State had not completed the proof as to the chain of custody, the court instructed the jury to disregard the exhibits and stated that the jury had not seen them because they were in a sack.",1
75,"“Asking harmless leading questions is not commended; yet, we note that the courts seldom reverse a case because questions are leading.”",1
75,"In fact, on cross-examination the prosecutrix testified several times that she was not threatened nor were any threats made upon her life by the appellants.",1
75,The trial court erred in submitting to the jury the issue of rape by threats.,1
75,This matter came before the court on Plaintiff's motion for an order to show cause.,1
76,"Thus, before reaching any federal constitutional issue, this Court must first decide the effect under Guam law of these two statutes when read together.",2
76,Defendant Boonprakong moved for dismissal of this action because it fails to state a claim against him upon which relief can be granted.,2
76,At issue are alleged irregularities occurring during grand jury proceedings consisting of discussions being held off-the-record.,2
76,The better practice is to record all proceedings had before the grand jury.,2
76,"As to the issue of hearsay, the Court finds these documents to be non-hearsay.",2
76,"It is now argued by the Government that it is not utilizing any information precluded by the order, but is relying only on information contained it its answer to the complaint.",2
76,"Having failed to provide proper answers to the requested interrogatories specifically relating to the ""Letter of Understanding"", this Court finds the Government is forthwith precluded from using such information in support of its motion for summary judgment.",2
76,"The discrepancy mentioned, together with the fact that one of the officers testified that he assisted appellant in walking whereas the other testified that he held appellant’s arm and did not even let him walk by himself, is pointed out in appellant’s brief.",2
76,What was his manner of walk at this time?,2
76,Why was it you assisted him?,2
76,"And, during this period of time that you talked with him, what was his manner of speech, how did he form his words and speak to you?",2
76,"The offense is assault with intent to murder; the punishment, seven years.",2
76,We must determine whether the court erred in declining to grant a mistrial.,2
76,The nature of the instrument used by appellant is of prime importance.,2
76,"Appellant excepted to the order of the trial court and gave notice of appeal to this court and sought to enter a recognizance, presenting two citizens of Bowie County alleged by him to be well qualified as sureties and who sought to make a recognizance for him.",2
76,The sole question presented us for review is the propriety of the trial judge’s action in denying bail or recognizance pending the appeal from the trial court’s order revoking probation.,2
76,"Appellant was indicted for robbery, the indictment alleging that he took two dollars from Charles Don Nichols on or about February 8, 1961.",2
76,"All of the foregoing occurred at the same term of court, hence the conviction as well as the revocation of probation is before us for review.",2
76,Appellant’s first claim of error is “The trial court erred in not granting defendant’s motion to strike all testimony relating to any evidence found in the room of the defendant as such information was obtained as the result of an illegal search and thus was inadmissible.”,2
76,"The remaining claim for reversal relates to the overruling of appellant’s motion for mistrial after Captain Johnson, upon being asked what happened when he first saw appellant in the hall on",2
76,We shall discuss the contentions urged by appellant in his brief and in oral argument.,2
76,He is being tried for murder.”,2
76,"Appellant next insists that State’s counsel committed reversible error in his jury argument when he stated: “While we are talking about George Sullivan, there was no objection to this statement and it was introduced in evidence but we proved that George Sullivan made a second statement * * *” Appellant insists that such remark presents reversible error notwithstanding the court’s instruction to the jury not to consider such statement because it was not shown that Sullivan made a second statement.",2
76,"Her defense, raised by her testimony, was self defense.",2
76,"Such an instruction need not be given when the state’s evidence is direct, nor if the facts proven are in such close juxtaposition to the main fact to be proved as to be equivalent to direct testimony.”",2
76,"By brief and oral argument, appellant’s counsel urges a reversal of this cause on what he terms “equitable grounds”.",2
76,"Appellant contends that since his acts did not result in death, and because of his age, we should reverse the case because the punishment is excessive.",2
76,Appellant complains that the indictment is defective in not charging him with using either “a” gun or “two” guns.,2
76,The appellant appealed to the County Criminal Court at Law No. 1 of Harris County.,2
76,Relator alleges that the judgment of conviction is void because the evidence adduced by the state at the trial was insufficient to show his guilt.,2
76,Relator further alleges that the charges in the indictment were false and known to the prosecution to be false and that such fact was suppressed from the grand jury and the court by the district attorney.,2
76,Relator alleges that such allegation is based upon the sworn statement of the prosecuting witness in the case.,2
76,Appellant contends that there is a fatal variance because Hadley testified that he later learned that both of the girls who,2
76,"Appellant insists that he should not be extradited, because the 142nd District Court of Midland County had, at the instigation of the State of Nebraska, exercised jurisdiction over him under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, Aft.",2
76,"Appellant further urges a fatal variance in the allegations of the requisition papers because the complaints annexed to the application for requisition alleged that he was in the State of Nebraska when the offense was committed and the application alleged that he committed the offense in Texas, resulting in a crime in the State of Nebraska.",2
76,The indictment alleged the voluntary killing with malice aforethought of Tommy Box by shooting him with a gun.,2
76,"Appellant’s first ground for reversal is that Criminal District Court No. 5 of Harris County, where the case was tried, had no jurisdiction because the indictment was returned into Criminal District Court No. 3 of Harris County, and the cause was never transferred from said Criminal District Court No. 3.",2
76,"Appellant again urges that this cause should be reversed because there was not a proper transfer of the case from Criminal District Court No. 3 to Criminal District Court No. 5 in accordance with Article 52-158b, Sec.",2
76,"The conviction is for forgery; the punishment, enhanced by two prior convictions for felonies less than capital, life imprisonment, as provided by Art. 63, V.A.P.C.",2
76,Appellant predicates his appeal upon two contentions.,2
76,He first insists that the court erred in overruling his motion to postpone the trial for a period of two days on the ground that the copy of the indictment served upon him while in jail did not correspond to the indictment upon which he was tried.,2
76,"Appellant next insists that the check in question was void on its face because the name of the drawee bank was not shown therein and, for such reason, it could not be the subject of forgery.",2
76,"In his brief and in oral argument appellant contends that because the name of the drawee bank was omitted from the check, it was not a negotiable instrument, and therefore, was not the subject of forgery.",2
76,"“Ordinarily a fair test of whether an instrument in writing alleged to be forged is the subject of forgery is: would the holder of same, if the same were true, be enabled to maintain or defeat a civil suit by such instrument?”",2
76,Appellant first contends that his arrest was illegal.,2
76,"He next complains of the overruling of his motion for new trial in which he alleged jury misconduct and misconduct of the State’s witness, Karalis, in communicating with a member of the jury.",2
76,Relator challenges the validity of Subdivision (g) of Article 14.08 of the Election Code on the grounds that no penal provision is mentioned in the caption which reads as follows:,2
76,"The question of the validity of a penal provision of the Election Code was not before the court in that case, and the same is not authority in the case at bar.",2
76,Appellant insists that the court erred in admitting the evidence showing the results of the drunkometer test because his consent to take the test was rendered involuntary by reason of certain promises made to him by the arresting officer.,2
76,"Appellant’s contention is based upon the fact that Officer Garrison, in addition to telling appellant that if he took the test and it showed he was intoxicated, it would be used against him, also told him that if it showed that he was not intoxicated, he would be released.",2
76,Appellant next insists that the court erred in permitting Officer Fisk to testify as to the results of the drunkometer test over appellant’s objection that he was not shown to be qualified as an expert.,2
76,Appellant next insists that the court erred in permitting the State to call Officer Jarke to testify after it had been stipulated before the jury as to what his testimony would be.,2
76,The sole question presented and urged upon the appeal is the contention that appellant’s plea of former jeopardy should have been sustained.,2
76,"In his motion for rehearing appellant insists that his Bill of Exception No. 2, which we did not discuss in our original opinion, presents reversible error because it certifies that he was denied the right to present to the jury evidence in support of his plea of former jeopardy.",2
76,"The offense is operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway while intoxicated, after having been convicted of the misdemeanor offense of driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 90 days in jail and a fine of $100.",2
76,"Appellant’s first ground for reversal relates to defects and irregularities in the county court judgment, one of which was that the judgment ordered that the defendant’s driver’s license be suspended for 12 months, whereas the statutes provide for an automatic suspension of 6 months.",2
76,"The conviction is for statutory rape; the punishment, life.",2
76,The sole contention urged for reversal is that the state failed to prove penetration.,2
76,"The conviction is for unlawfully carrying a pistol; the punishment, 90 days in jail.",2
76,"The conviction is for driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 365 days in jail and a fine of $50.",2
76,"This is an appeal from an order refusing appellant bail, after indictment for murder.",2
76,"The offense is aggravated assault with a motor vehicle; the punishment, a fine of $500.00 and 60 days confinement in jail.",2
76,Appellant also complains of certain jury argument.,2
76,"Appellant presents as error an informal bill of exception, which, in our judgment, controls the disposition of this case.",2
76,"The State contends that under the authority of these cases, and the very general objections made by appellant, no error is shown.",2
76,"At the trial, appellant objected to the admission of the evidence showing the search and the results thereof for the reason that the search warrant was void.",2
76,"He attacks the affidavit on the ground that it is based on hearsay, did not set forth a statement of the offense in clear, plain and intelligible language, and was insufficient to authorize the issuance of the search warrant.",2
76,Appellant seriously contends that we were in error in considering the offense report which was made a part of the statement of facts by the trial court before he approved the same.,2
76,Appellant contends in his brief that he was not notified of the filing of or hearing on this motion.,2
76,Appellant questions the soundness of our prior opinion in which we held the affidavit upon which the search warrant was based to be sufficient.,2
76,"His contention is that the affidavit is insufficient to comply with our State or the Federal Constitution because, after describing the premises sought to be searched, it contained the following recitation:",2
76,His primary contention is that the phrases italicized above are not a sufficient statement of probable cause to comply with the Constitutions of the United States and of this State.,2
76,"The offense is abortion; the punishment, three years’ confinement in the penitentiary.",2
76,"The appellant’s only objection to the introduction of these exhibits was that “there is no predicate laid to show that they have any relevancy or materiality or competence in connection with the alleged offense on August 3, 1960.",2
76,Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the allegation “there by the use of said means produce an abortion of the said woman and did then and thereby destroy the life of the fetus in the womb of the said woman.”,2
76,He further contends that no evidence was adduced showing that the life of the fetus in the womb was destroyed.,2
76,"It is his contention that in the case at bar, at most, the State made out a case of bringing on a premature birth.",2
76,"Appellant first contends that the indictment in this case is fatally defective in that it does not allege that the appellant “unlawfully”, “willfully”, and “designedly” performed the abortion in question, and therefore fails to meet the requirements of Article 1191, V.A.P.C.",2
76,"Appellant argues that it is necessary to allege that the abortion was unlawful, because under some circumstances an abortion may be legally performed.",2
76,Appellant next contends that the opening argument of the prosecutor presents reversible error-,2
76,Objections were made regarding the testimony concerning certain medicine and drugs given to the complaining witness.,2
76,“Appellant also contends that the information is defective because it does not charge that the act complained of was prohibited or unlawful.,2
76,"The offense is carrying a pistol as a second offender; the punishment, confinement in jail for a period of 210 days.",2
76,"The conviction is for driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 3 days in jail and a fine of $50.",2
76,The issue of appellant’s intoxication was sharply contested.,2
76,"By informal bill of exception, appellant complains of the court’s action in permitting Officer Wagner to relate to the jury a statement made to him by appellant after his arrest and while he was being taken to jail.",2
76,"Appellant insists that the oral statement which he made to Officer Wagner, following his arrest, was in the nature of a confession and should not have been admitted in evidence because it was not made in compliance with our confession statute, Art. 727, V.A.C.C.P.",2
76,The state insists that the statement was admissible in evidence as a part of the res gestae.,2
76,"The offense is attempting to pass as true a forged instrument; the punishment, two years.",2
76,The indictment alleged that appellant attempted to pass the check set forth therein to Mae John Landers.,2
76,He first contends that the indictment is defective because it fails to explain what sum was meant by the words “forty eight fifty Dollars” as they appear on the face of the check.,2
76,The offense is the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor,2
76,Appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction.,2
76,He points out these additional facts: No alcoholic beverages were found on appellant’s premises except a can of beer found in his house.,2
76,"Appellant, if we understand his position correctly, contends that the evidence did not overcome the outstanding hypothesis that Orby Arthur and not he possessed the intoxicants.",2
76,The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction is challenged.,2
76,"The question is whether the circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, is sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding that the appellant is the person who committed the offense.",2
76,"The remaining complaint relates to the testimony of Officer Kennedy that a suit of clothes was found in appellant’s room, which was identified by the witness as the suit appellant was wearing at the time of the trial, in which the knife above referred to was found.",2
76,"The contention is that the clothing was not the subject of a lawful search and seizure, it being purely evidentiary.",2
76,"The offense is receiving and concealing stolen property over the value of $50; the punishment, five years.",2
76,"The offense is murder without malice; the punishment, 3 years.",2
76,The convictions are for the misdemeanor offense of unlawful assembly under Arts.,2
76,"The offense is possession of wine for the purpose of sale in a dry area, two prior convictions being alleged for enhancement of punishment; the punishment assessed by the jury, six months in jail and a fine of $400.",2
76,"The conviction is for keeping a disorderly house; the punishment, 20 days in jail and a fine of $200.",2
76,Appellant insists that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction because it does not show that the house in question was one of prostitution.,2
76,"The offense of statutory rape was alleged to have been committed on or about May 17, 1961; the punishment, 40 years.",2
76,Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying him the right to question every venireman as to whether he had conscientious scruples regarding the giving of the death penalty in a proper case.,2
76,"The offense is the unlawful possession of a narcotic drug, marijuana; the punishment, twenty-five years in the penitentiary.",2
76,"Appellant’s bills of exception 5, 6, 7, and 8 complain of the action of the trial court in admitting certain judgments showing appellant and defense witness, Billie Yvonne Coleman, to have been previously convicted in several causes in two justice of the peace courts in Dallas County of the offense of vagrancy.",2
76,Appellant’s principal objection to the admissibility of these judgments was that the state failed to establish the identity of the appellant and the witness Coleman as being the same persons as set forth in these judgments.,2
76,"The conviction is for robbery with firearms; the punishment, fifty years.",2
76,"Appellant insists that his arrest was illegal, and the search of his person resulting in the finding of the revolver was invalid, and the introduction of the revolver in evidence was error.",2
76,"The offense is felony theft; the punishment, two years.",2
76,Appellant also contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction because the State failed to disprove his exculpatory statement which was introduced into evidence by the State.,2
76,"The conviction is for murder without malice; the punishment, two years.",2
76,Appellant strenuously challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction.,2
76,Appellant first contends that the trial court erred in refusing her motion for an instructed verdict of not guilty when the state rested its case at the close of Officer Wagner’s testimony because of the insufficiency of the evidence.,2
76,"Appellant was convicted of unlawfully transporting an alcoholic beverage in a dry area, with two prior convictions for offenses of like character alleged for the purpose of enhancement, and his punishment was assessed at six months’ confinement in jail and a fine of $500.",2
76,"Upon his plea of guilty before the court, a jury being waived, appellant was found guilty of assault with intent to murder with malice, and assessed a punishment of 15 years.",2
76,"Relator, upon his plea of guilty, was convicted in the Justice Court, Precinct No. 3 of Bexar County, Texas, for “speeding” and assessed a fine of $50.00.",2
76,"The offense is driving a motor vehicle upon a public highway while intoxicated; the punishment, 3 days in jail and a fine of $50.",2
76,"The offense is driving a motor vehicle upon a public highway while intoxicated; the punishment, 3 days in jail and a fine of $100.",2
76,"Appellant’s objection, and the complaint he here presents, is that the foregoing remarks were erroneous and prejudicial because he had the right to remain silent, and the fact that he did so while in custody was not admissible against him.",2
76,"P.C., for the offense of murder without malice with punishment assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for a term of five years.",2
76,"If we properly construe appellant’s brief, he now contends that the record raised an issue as to the voluntary nature of appellant’s confession and that such question should have been submitted to the jury.",2
76,Appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the jury’s finding that the posts were of the value of over $50.00.,2
76,He contends that the court erred in permitting the State to ask leading questions.,2
76,Appellant also contends that the court erred in not granting his motion for a mistrial when the court allowed the State to introduce into evidence certain blood stained seat covers and then ordered them withdrawn from evidence when the State failed to connect them with the offense.,2
77,"The defendant interposed as a defense to the granting of such a motion that §139 of the Civil Code which provides for the payment of child support by fathers, but not by mothers, is a violation of equal protection of the law on the basis of sex.",3
77,There can be little doubt that Civil Code §139 is exactly the sort of law condemned as a violation of the equal protection of the laws by Orr v. Orr 99 S.Ct.,3
77,"First, Civil Code §138 provides a basis for the award of child support which is not sex based.",3
77,"14-28(b), which provides ""Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.14-28(b), which provides ""Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.",3

77,"In this respect, a 1977 decision from the Court of Appeals of Arizona is particularly instructive.",3
77,"Pursuant to Government Code §6500.15, trial was before the court, without jury.",3

77,"Further, Government Code §21512(c), which was passed as part of the Guam Power Authority Act of 1968, as originally passed, specifically states that the manager, secretary, treasurer, comptroller and attorney of the Authority are not within the classified service of the Government of Guam.",3

77,"We are not unmindful of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, in Baysden v. U.S., 271 Fed. 2d 325, where it was held that an affidavit for a warrant was not sufficient under Rule 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., unless it stated, in addition to the grounds or probable cause for its issuance, the names of the persons whose affidavits had been taken in support thereof.",3
77,"The words “designedly”, “wilfully”, and “unlawfully” are not essential in charging the offense in this case under Article 1191, V.A.P.C., and the indictment here is not fundamentally defective.",3
77,“Nor need the State aver in expressed terms that the act charged was ‘unlawfully’ done where the facts alleged clearly show it to be unlawful.”,3
77,"The Constitution (Article VI, Section 38) provides that an indictment shall conclude with the words ‘against the peace and dignity of the State’.",3

77,A charge on circumstantial evidence is not required where the testimony directly connects the accused with the offense.,3
77,"104, Section 243, states that crimes that involve moral turpitude, so as to make a conviction or charge of them available as impeaching matter, include the following offenses: any felony;",3
77,The court or jury trying the case is not confined to the testimony of the state in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction.,3
77,It is well settled in this state that an information which does not appear to have been presented by the prosecuting attorney is fatally defective and insufficient.,3
77,"Bill of Exception No. 1 certifies that “there was no person other than the Defendant who might have testified concerning the matter of whether or not the defendant has a slur or has lumbago, as was discussed in the prosecutor’s argument.”",3
77,Bill No. 3 certifies that “there was no person other than the Defendant to whom the prosecutor’s argument 'this man was sworn in’ could have referred.”,3
77,"The holding was that such testimony and argument offended the rule that whether warned or not, the silence of the defendant while under arrest cannot be used against him as a confession of the truth of statements made in his presence by his codefendants or anybody else.",3
77,The rule relied upon by appellant does not appear to be applicable here.,3
77,"In the absence of a judgment entered of record in the minutes of the court, the appeal must be dismissed.",3
77,"Where no judgment of conviction was found in the record, the Court of Criminal Appeals had no jurisdiction of the appeal.",3
77,"State’s Exhibit 16, which was admitted without any objection to the effect that it was inflammatory, is a picture of the front seat of the automobile in question with the plastic seat covers in place.",3
77,"Appellants contend there is no proof of threats of death or great bodily harm as that term is defined by Art. 1185, V.A.P.C., to support the submission to the jury of the issue of rape by threats, and therefore that the court below erred in submitting same over their objection.",3
78,"Thus, even if §139 were found to be void as urged, there is a basis for the award of child support.",4
78,"Second, although this statute as written is violative of the Constitution, and by authority of Orr v. Orr void, this court need not reach this result, or indeed a federal constitutional issue, in this case.",4
78,"Though the test is imprecise, a court must weigh the general interest in retaining the statute against the court's reluctance to extend legislation to those not previously covered.",4
78,"Such an inquiry may lead a court into examination of legislative purpose, the overall statutory scheme, statutory arrangements in connected fields and the needs of the public.",4
78,"""When a statute, either alone or in conjunction with another statute or statutes, infringes on constitutional rights, this court has an obligation to make every effort to salvage the statute by an appropriate exclusion so long as legislative intent will not be frustrated thereby.""",4
78,"Although plaintiff has no record of the cancellation the testimony received indicates that a record of the cancellation might not have been made or if made, might have been destroyed.",4
78,It therefore appears that Mr. Cate would not be liable for any of the present judgment.,4
78,"Thus, it is required in Guam that a transcript be made and that copies be provided for both the prosecuting attorney and each defendant.",4
78,"This being the law, we find merit in appellants' claim of possible prejudice arising from the failure of the Territorial Grand Jury to record all of the proceedings before them.",4
78,The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants.,4
78,"Granted, we are not able to say with any certitude that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these discussions.",4
78,"But we are not willing to speculate that they were not, nor should a defendant be asked to guess and be burdened with proving that he was.",4
78,The language of the court in Pipes is equally appropriate to the matter now on appeal before this Court.,4
78,"Further, while we are not aware of the nature of the off-the-record discussions, we find it necessary to add that, although it is the role of the prosecutor to draw such indictments as the grand jury directs, he may not give advice as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in any matter, nor may he in any way seek to influence the grand jury to find or not to find any indictment, nor may he take part in any of the grand jury's deliberations, as these are all matters wholly within the exclusive province of the grand jury.",4
78,Off-the-record discussions may lend credence to such criticism.,4
78,"The Government further contends that such documents are hearsay, violate the Best Evidence Rule, and are not properly authenticated.",4
78,"Plaintiff, on oral argument, stated that the challenged documents were submitted for the purpose of estopping the Government from asserting as a defense the untimely filing of plaintiff's claim and action.",4
78,This Court finds that Rule 408 creates an exception for the admissibility of evidence otherwise inadmissible if offered for purposes other than to prove liability.,4
78,"Plaintiff does not seek to establish that the documents of compromise are an admission of liability on the part of the Government, but merely that negotiations were ongoing they are admissible.",4
78,"With regard to the Best Evidence argument, where an original is unobtainable, or within the control of the party opponent, the Rule creates an exception for the introduction of copy in lieu of the original.",4
78,"Based on the foregoing, this Court finds no ground to strike the documents as submitted by plaintiff, and accordingly DENIES the Government's motion.",4
78,"This Court believes that the order of September 11th clearly circumvents this argument, and that said order is an unconditional prohibition upon the Government from using any information relating to questions not properly answered.",4
78,"1 During the course of the trial, the plaintiff's proof having established that plaintiff was within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident, the court itself raised the issue of whether or not this action was barred under the Workmen's compensation Law, Government Code Sections 37000 et.",4
78,"If plaintiff is not an employee of the Government of Guam, then §37005 is no bar to this action.",4
78,"However, Government Code §21502 is, at first blush, ambiguous.",4
78,"If the Guam Power Authority is ""autonomous"" as set forth in §21502, how can an agency relationship exist between it and the Government of Guam?",4
78,"Yet, the same §21502 sets forth that the Guam Power Authority is an ""instrumentality"" of the Government of Guam.",4
78,"Where the court is faced with two interpretations, one of which would hold the statute wholly void and the other of which would uphold the statute, it is clear that the legislative intent must be the latter interpretations.",4
78,"Where it appears clearly from the tenor of the statute that employees of the Authority are employees of the Government, and the Legislature specifically exempts certain people from the operation of the statue, it is strong evidence that the",4
78,"Although the Fund may recoup these payments from the Authority on an annual basis pursuant to this Section, the liability for Workmen's Compensation payments is upon the Government of Guam.",4
78,"Thus, the bare fact that compensation to plaintiff under the Worlonen's Compensation Law would come from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund is sufficient to bar plaintiff's claim under Government Code §37005.",4
78,"This Section does not, therefore, override the specific provisions of Government Code 37005 that make the Workmen's Compensation Law the exclusive remedy against the Government of Guam in some cases.",4
78,"Obviously prison administrators have great discretion in supervising prisoners; however, it is only when a prisoner's actions might reasonably endanger prison security or the safety of the public in general, that a prisoner's vested rights may be temporarily suspended prior to a full and adequate hearing.",4
78,"This is not to minimize the seriousness of the offenses charged; however, benefits afforded a prisoner on a work-release program are similar to those of a prisoner on parole, thus requiring greater rights to a hearing than might normally be associated with general prison discipline and administrative procedures.",4
78,The uncontradicted testimony of Root and Reyes suggest that the right to confront and produce witnesses was limited when their cases were heard.,4
78,"In some cases the gravity of certain offenses could justify the disciplinary removal of a prisoner from work release prior to a full hearing; however, no exigent circumstances to justify such removal have been shown by the Government to exist in the cases at bar.",4
78,"However, assuming that these sections apply to the petitioners, it would seem that the Director conversely has no authority to remove prisoners from the Halfway House Correctional Facility without the express approval of the parole board.",4
78,"There is no question that the petitioners' rights guaranteed under Wolff v. McDonnel, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct.",4
78,"2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and its progeny (e.g. Durso v. Rowe, supra) were ignored by the Director of Corrections.",4
78,The Court bases its decision upon the sufficiency of the summons mailed in December pursuant to the order for publication.,4
78,It would seem inequitable for this court to bind defendant to the two (2) month requirement for response when due in part to clerical error by the clerk the summons was served in a defective state.,4
78,"Therefore, defendant shall be allowed an additional period within which to file her answer in this case.",4
78,In view of our disposition of the case a summary of the facts is unnecessary.,4
78,"The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction, and no error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.",4
78,The sole ground for reversal is the contention that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.,4
78,"There being sufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict, the discrepancies in the testimony of the officers do not render such evidence insufficient to sustain the conviction.",4
78,"The court charged on appellant’s right of self-defense against an unlawful attack by Hartwell, based upon the testimony that Hartwell made the first overt act with the lantern.",4
78,This was a proper submission of the defensive issue raised by the evidence.,4
78,"This was predicated upon the evidence concerning the pursuit by appellant from the cafe to the roadside park, his assault with the flexible club at that point, his continued pursuit after the Hartwells left the park, coupled with his act of ramming the rear end of the automobile in which the Hartwells were riding and his act of stopping at the filling station in question and alighting, armed with the weapon heretofore described.",4
78,"Under the evidence, we find no error in the giving of the charge.",4
78,"Having disposed of the most difficult question in the case, we pass on to the sufficiency of the evidence to support this conviction for assault with intent to murder.",4
78,"Its only possible use, apparent to us, is to inflict injury and is the type that would be fabricated and carried by one planning to engage in an assault upon another person.",4
78,It is difficult to see anything “good or respectable” in such conduct.,4
78,We find no reversible error reflected by the testimony of Hartwell that he felt he was going to be killed by the assault.,4
78,There was no error in admitting the testimony relating to appellant’s res gestae statement that he had been in the “pen” before.,4
78,There was no error in permitting the witness Coffman to testify that after the day charged in the indictment he had a conversation with appellant in which appellant asked him to go talk to Hartwell and offer him a thousand dollars “if he wouldn’t push the case or if he would drop it”.,4
78,We have examined the remaining bills of exception and fail to find error reflected thereby.,4
78,The State’s evidence shows that the deceased operated a liquor store in the City of Houston.,4
78,"The trial judge refused to grant leave to appellant to file the motion for new trial but heard the evidence, at the conclusion of which he stated that he was of the opinion that he had no authority to grant permission to file the motion for new trial after 10 days had elapsed and overruled it.",4
78,The trial court’s finding that appellant was in fact 17 years of age at the time of his trial cannot be sustained in view of the evidence mentioned.,4
78,There is an absence of any showing as to appellant’s ability to make such payment or that his failure was willful.,4
78,"Assuming that the theft of the beer was committed during the term of probation, it is not clear that the trial judge would have exercised his discretion and revoked appellant’s probation had he known at the time that appellant while of juvenile age could not ordinarily be convicted of a criminal offense by reason of such breaking and theft.",4
78,"It is also not clear that the trial judge would not have reconsidered and set aside his order revoking probation when it was shown at the hearing on appellant’s motion for new trial that he had even then not arrived at the age of 17, had he not been of the opinion that he was without authority to do so.",4
78,We do not agree that the motion for instructed verdict may be considered as a motion to exclude the evidence relating to the recovery of the stolen property admitted without proper objection.,4
78,The facts distinguish this case from the recent case of Hicks v.,4
78,"In the absence of a bond or recognizance on appeal, or a showing that appellant is in jail, we are without jurisdiction of this misdemeanor appeal.",4
78,Proof was offered that Hale County was a dry area; and also of the prior conviction alleged and that the appellant was the same person so convicted.,4
78,"When State’s counsel withdrew his objection to Sullivan testifying, the witness could have then been called by appellant to testify as if no objection had been made.",4
78,We find nothing in the remarks of State’s counsel with reference to Sullivan being tried for murder which was so obviously prejudicial that its effect upon the jury could not be removed by the court’s instruction not to consider the same.,4
78,"Our examination of the record reflects that the State did show, by the witness Evans, that Sullivan made a second written statement on April 21, but that the same was not introduced in evidence.",4
78,"Appellant insists that the court erred in charging on the law of principals because appellant’s companion, Sullivan, was under indictment as an accessory to the crime and therefore could not be a principal to the murder.",4
78,The fact that Sullivan was under indictment as an accessory to the murder did not foreclose proof by the State that appellant and Sullivan acted together as principals in the commission of the offense.,4
78,"Under the State’s evidence showing that Sullivan was present and participated with appellant in the killing of the deceased, the court correctly charged the jury on the law of their acting together as principals.",4
78,"Finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.",4
78,We have again carefully considered the record in the light of appellant’s contentions and remain convinced that it does not show reversible error.,4
78,Such omissions constitute an undue restriction upon appellant’s defense and call for reversal.,4
78,"In refusing to give the charge on circumstantial evidence, the court fell into error.",4
78,In the instant case the main fact sought to be proved was that appellant possessed the morphine in question.,4
78,"While he was present on the premises when it was found, there is no direct evidence that he owned or controlled the premises.",4
78,"Although an officer testified that he had observed appellant enter the premises on four or five different occasions, he did not testify, positively, that appellant lived in the apartment but did testify that Linda Blaylock lived there.",4
78,Appellant’s guilt of possessing the morphine is made to depend upon the inference to be drawn by his presence on the premises on the occasion in question and the other facts and circumstances shown by the evidence.,4
78,"Proof of his mere presence on the premises at the time the offense was committed, although made by direct evidence, is insufficient to support the conviction.",4
78,"Under the record, a charge on circumstantial evidence should have been given.",4
78,We are unable to agree with the state that because the court instructed the jury on the law of principals a charge on circumstantial evidence was not required.,4
78,Appellant’s guilt as a principal also depended on proof by circumstantial evidence.,4
78,"We are aware of no statute which makes it an offense to “unlawfully and wilfully Pass-insufficient Clearance”, and it is clear that if there were such a statute it would be void for indefiniteness.",4
78,"We do not deem it necessary to review the holding of this Court in Ex Parte Jonischkies, 88 Texas Cr.",4
78,"In the latter case we said that the inquiry “* *•* is not whether there is in the indictment such specific allegation of the details of the charge as would make it good on demurrer, but whether the indictment describes a class of offense of which the court has jurisdiction and alleges the defendant to be guilty.”",4
78,"We hold that where, as here, no facts are alleged in the complaint which, if true, constitute an offense, and no facts are alleged which show that offense was meant to be charged, a final conviction under such complaint is void and may be attacked by habeas corpus.",4
78,We find the evidence amply sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict.,4
78,"We find the indictment to be in the usual form, which has been approved many times.",4
78,"While the evidence may show that appellant emptied his own gun on Dodson before using Dodson’s gun, it does not cause a variance.",4
78,"Appellant, being charged with robbery by use of and exhibiting a firearm, did just that.",4
78,"We find the charge of exhibiting “a firearm, to-wit: gun” proper.",4
78,We have examined the informal bills of exception appearing in the record and find no reversible error therein.,4
78,This was clearly an effort to impeach the witness upon an immaterial matter and was properly excluded by the court.,4
78,The newly discovered evidence would have only tended to impeach the testimony of the State’s witnesses and is not a ground for new trial in this state.,4
78,It has been consistently held that a variance between the complaint and the information as to the date when the offense was committed is fatal to the validity of the information.,4
78,"The assistant supervisor, so far as this record discloses, had no authority to carry a pistol and had no authority to deputize appellant so as to authorize him to do so.",4
78,"Finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.",4
78,"Art. 484 P.C. does not except from Art. 483 P.C. an employee of a detective agency, hence the advice of the assistant supervisor to appellant that he could lawfully carry a pistol was not a defense.",4
78,There is no. evidence to support his objection.,4
78,The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction of the appellant as charged.,4
78,"The other contentions presented have been considered, and they do not show error.",4
78,Proof that the named female was procured “to be” at the place named for the purpose of meeting and having sexual inter•course with a male person constituted an offense under the statute.,4
78,The evidence is deemed sufficient to sustain the allegations of the complaint and information.,4
78,"Upon such verdict, judgment was entered finding appellant “guilty of the offense of Unlawfully with lascivious intent, intentionally place his hands and the fingers of his hands upon and against the sexual parts of a female person under the age of fourteen years, a felony, as found by the jury”.",4
78,The verdict returned by the jury finding appellant guilty of the offense of “molesting” is clearly not responsive to the crime charged in the first count of the indictment.,4
78,"Such verdict, not being responsive to the crime charged and submitted to the jury was a nullity and could not support the judgment and sentence entered by the court.",4
78,"For the want of a valid verdict, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.",4
78,"While the record reflects that prior to the extradition proceedings a petition had been filed in the 142nd District Court of Midland County against appellant under the Uniform Support Act, there is no showing that appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and complied with any order of support.",4
78,"The remaining ground for reversal relates to the court’s charge wherein the jury was instructed that if the statement of appellant, introduced in evidence, contained exculpatory matters, the state would be bound thereby unless shown to be untrue under all the evidence in the case.",4
78,We do not find in appellant’s confession any statement which would exculpate him.,4
78,All of the statements in the confession were consistent with guilt.,4
78,"We observe, however, that the instruction on exculpatory statements found in the court’s charge appears to be sufficient under the rule stated in 1 Branch’s Ann.",4
78,We also remain convinced that we properly disposed of appellant’s contention relating to the court’s charge on exculpatory statements on original submission.,4
78,The prior convictions were proved by certain prison records and comparison of finger prints in the manner which has been held sufficient by this Court.,4
78,The variance in the instant case between the original indictment and the copy was not of such a material nature as to mislead the appellant.,4
78,"Under the rules above stated, the check in the instant case was clearly an instrument which could be the subject of forgery.",4
78,We have examined the authorities cited by appellant and they do not support such a holding.,4
78,The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.,4
78,The jury resolved the issue of appellant’s guilt in favor of the State and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict.,4
78,The record before us contains no formal bills of exception and there are no objections to the court’s charge.,4
78,The motion for new trial is but a pleading and as such must be supported by proof.,4
78,"If the presence of notice to the Legislature and the public has caused a difference of opinion in this Court, after careful study and with the aid of able counsel, then it is apparent that such notice was not brought home to the members of the Legislature or the public.",4
78,"If so, relator is not entitled to be discharged.",4
78,"As I see it, the Legislature had authority to adopt and establish an election code without repealing the penal provisions of existing statutes and to provide a punishment by fine or imprisonment for the violation of certain of its provisions, without any reference in the caption to its penal provisions.",4
78,The provision in the caption that nothing in the election code shall be construed as repealing or in any way affecting the legality of any penal provision of the existing law does not suggest to me that the statute contains no penal provision.,4
78,This is especially true because one or more of the acts for which a fine or imprisonment is provided in the election code do not appear to have been punishable as offenses under existing statutes.,4
78,"Since there is no showing that appellant agreed to the discharge of the jury, it will be assumed that he did not.",4
78,"Since there is no statement of facts on the merits in this case, this Court cannot consider the nature of the evidence in determining whether the trial court used discretion.",4
78,We find that the trial court did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the jury could not agree upon a verdict and in discharging them and declaring a mistrial.,4
78,We further hold that the discharge of the jury at the former trial did not constitute jeopardy barring another trial.,4
78,We know of no authority which sustains appellant’s contention that he was entitled to have a jury finding on the issue raised by his plea of former jeopardy before any evidence was heard on the charge of murder.,4
78,"While the cases cited by appellant sustain his contention that he was entitled to introduce evidence before the jury for the purpose of discharging the burden resting upon him of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his plea was true, there is no showing in this record that appellant tendered evidence before the jury in support of his plea after the court had properly refused to permit such evidence to be offered in advance of a hearing on the merits.",4
78,We remain convinced that Judge Todd did not err in overruling the plea of former jeopardy.,4
78,"“After the cause is submitted to the jury, they may be discharged when they cannot agree and both parties consent to their discharge; or the court may in its discretion discharge them where they have been kept together for such time as to render it altogether improbable that they can agree.”",4
78,“As to whether the jury have been held for such a time as to render it ‘altogether improbable that they can agree’ is addressed to the discretion of the judge.,4
78,"In any event, the exercise of discretion will be measured by the time the jury have been kept together, considered in the light of the nature of the case and the evidence.”",4
78,We do not feel that the testimony of the doctor solved any issue in the case.,4
78,We do not deem the defects such as would render the judgment insufficient for use in charging a subsequent offense of driving while intoxicated.,4
78,"Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the evidence is deemed sufficient to show penetration.",4
78,The jury chose to accept the testimony of the State’s witnesses and reject that of the appellant and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict.,4
78,We have carefully examined the informal bills of exception appearing in the statement of facts to the court’s rulings on the admission or rejection of testimony and the appellant’s objections to certain jury argument by State’s counsel and find no reversible error therein.,4
78,"The reference by State’s counsel in his closing argument to the appellant’s record in the hands of the district attorney and that he had previously entered a plea of guilty to carrying a concealed weapon does not present reversible error as such statement was clearly invited and in reply to the argument of appellant’s counsel when he stated to the jury, in substance, that the State had appellant’s record and if he had done anything wrong they would know about it.",4
78,The fact that the felony punishment has been reduced since the conviction is not ground for attacking the conviction by habeas corpus.,4
78,The judgment and sentence as recorded in the minutes show a conviction for assault with intent to murder.,4
78,They do not disclose that the conviction was for assault with intent to murder with malice or that the offense was committed by laying in wait.,4
78,This would not vitiate the judgment where the indictment so alleged and the conviction was upon a plea of guilty to the offense charged in the indictment.,4
78,We have concluded that the evidence is sufficient to corroborate the testimony of the accomplice and sufficient to authorize the jury to accept her testimony given at the trial and to disbelieve the defense presented.,4
78,"For this reason, the record before us fails to raise an issue as to the voluntary nature of the confession, and the authorities upon which appellant relies have no application.",4
78,"There being no formal bills of exception or statement of facts containing the argument complained of, this matter is not before us for review.",4
78,"We have carefully examined all of the authorities cited by both the State in its brief and also all of the numerous cases cited in Massoletti, supra.",4
78,"This testimony was no doubt prejudicial and inflamatory to the rights of the appellant before the jury, and it probably resulted in the imposition of a heavier penalty than would have been imposed absent this testimony.",4
78,"While the appellant’s counsel might not have made a specific objection to the testimony, the general rule being that an objection should be specific, naming a particular rule of evidence which will be violated by the admission of the evidence, the purpose of such a requirement is two-fold: (1) It enables the judge to understand the precise question and to make an intelligent ruling, and (2) It affords the offering party an opportunity to remedy the defect if possible.",4
78,"We here think that the trial judge fully understood the question, but that he later fell into error in admitting the testimony after he had stated: “Gentlemen, in this case the injuries were less than death.",4
78,"We believe that while the objection of counsel might not have been specific, this is the type of case where any form of objection is sufficient.",4
78,We hold that the evidence was obviously not admissible for any purpose.,4
78,Whether the victim of the assault was a pedestrian or an occupant of a vehicle would not alter the rule that evidence as to the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted on the assaulted person is admissible regardless of the nature of the charge of aggravated assault contained in the indictment.,4
78,"In that case, however, we discussed the Allen case and pointed out the danger of proving unnecessary ‘gory details.’ ”",4
78,An examination of the report shows nothing therein which could have been used to impeach the testimony given by the witnesses Strickland and Rodgers.,4
78,In the absence of any showing of injury or prejudice the court’s refusal to require the production of the offense report is not ground for reversal.,4
78,The evidence is amply sufficient to support the verdict of the jury.,4
78,An examination of the affidavit shows that it recites sufficient facts and information to constitute probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.,4
78,"Since the statements of the two witnesses were made available to this Court, appellant is in no position to complain.",4
78,To hold otherwise would be tantamount to saying that an accused is entitled to a reversal of his conviction even though it is apparent that he was not injured by the rulings of the trial court.,4
78,This Court has often held that an affidavit identical to the one above constitutes a sufficient recitation of “probable cause”.,4
78,We are aware of no decision of the Supreme Court of the United States holding that such an affidavit is insufficient.,4
78,We agree that Tonnahill is controlling for the facts as stated in that case.,4
78,"However, in the case at bar, the facts are different.",4
78,"We find the evidence sufficient, as adduced by the State from the complaining witness, Jo Ann Williams, as heretofore stated by us, to overcome appellant’s contention.",4
78,"While the word “designedly” seems to apply only when the offense is committed by the administration of drugs or medicines, it would appear to be necessary to allege that it was done “knowingly” or “designedly” to support an indictment under this phase of the statute.",4
78,"Where the offense is charged by alleging other means, as in the present case, it is not necessary to allege that the act was done “designedly” or “knowingly” where, as here, the indictment alleged",4
78,"These words were placed in the charge defining the offense, and appellant may not therefore complain of the court’s action in that regard.",4
78,"Under the indictment and all the proof offered, we think such argument may well have been a proper comment upon the evidence.",4
78,"It certainly does not appear that the argument of State’s counsel was so material in character that, considering the evidence and circumstances and the immediate instruction of the court to the jury to disregard such argument, the rights of the appellant were so injuriously affected and the argument was so harmful as to cause this Court to hold that it was reversible error.",4
78,"This Court has held on many occasions that where counsel makes remarks that were improper, and the court immediately instructs the jury to disregard such remarks, the error is usually cured and reversal seldom results.",4
78,"“The indictment alleged that the appellant did ‘designedly thrust and force into the vagina * * Appellant contends that it is defective because it did not allege ‘unlawfully, wilfully and designedly’- We find further in the indictment the allegation that the appellant ‘did then and there by the use of said means unlawfuly, wilfully and designedly produce an abortion’ upon the prosecutrix.",4
78,"This, we think, is sufficient if in fact such allegations are necessary.”",4
78,"“By a motion to quash appellant assailed the indictment, because it omitted the charge that appellant ‘unlawfully’ possessed the intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale.",4
78,We think the indictment not vulnerable to the attack.,4
78,"It charged the existence of facts which, if sustained, show a violation of the law.",4
78,"It was not necessary for the information to say that the acts of defendant were contrary to the statute, when the facts alleged of themselves showed that they were contrary to the statute.”",4
78,“Nothing in this chapter applies to an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.”,4
78,"Thus, there was a fatal variance between the information and the proof in two respects; i.e., the number of the cause and the date of the conviction.",4
78,We are unable to agree that the statement was shown to be a part of the res gestae.,4
78,"The admission in evidence of appellant’s oral statement to the arresting officer while under arrest, which was in the nature of a confession, was error and calls for a reversal of the conviction.",4
78,The reasons stated in my dissent would be applicable here if appellant’s statement was in the nature of a confession.,4
78,“We have re-examined the bill and find the only grounds of objection set forth therein to be: ‘that the oral statements made by the defendant after he had been detained and stopped by the officers were made while under arrest and inadmissible.’ It follows that the question of whether the statements were or were not a part of the res gestae was not before the trial court and therefore cannot be raised here.”,4
78,"In the indictment before us here, the words “forty eight fifty Dollars” are merely ambiguous and do not call for a different sum of money other than $48.50.",4
78,We find no merit in appellant’s contention that a variance existed because the check bore such printed matter as “when written in ink this check is insured * * * ” while the indictment failed to contain these printed words.,4
78,* * * A variance in names so trifling that it is inconceivable that defendant could have been misled or prejudiced thereby is immaterial.,4
78,* * * A variance as to name in an indictment has been held not fatal if it is not the name averred to be forged.’,4
78,This Court held that failure to copy such words in the indictment did not create a variance.,4
78,"There is no evidence to show that the trails between appellant’s premises and the places where the liquor was found were made by appellant, or that he had anything to do with them.",4
78,"The remaining ground for reversal is predicated upon the fact that the court in his charge treated the prosecution as being for possession of liquor, whereas the information alleged the possession of an alcoholic beverage, to-wit, whisky, vodka and beer.",4
78,"The effect of the charge was to relieve appellant of the accusation of possession of beer, and to require the jury to find, in order to convict, that appellant possessed liquor for the purpose of sale.",4
78,"This is demonstrated by the further fact that the prima facie rule regarding the possession of more than a quart of liquor in a dry area was given to the jury, and there was no reference made to the prima facie rule regarding possession of alcoholic beverages such as beer.",4
78,"If there was error in the charge, it was waived by the failure of appellant to object in the trial court.",4
78,"Also, the charge given was favorable to appellant and the error, if any, was harmless.",4
78,We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict finding the appellant guilty of murder with malice.,4
78,"The question having been asked and answered before the objection, and there being no effort to have the evidence withdrawn from the jury, no error is presented warranting reversal.",4
78,"We think that appellant’s contention that the evidence is insufficient to corroborate the testimony of the two accomplices, Nations and Matthews, has merit.",4
78,We have carefully reviewed and considered all of the testimony adduced and have set forth above all of the pertinent testimony that the state offered.,4
78,He was not asked if they were the same shells brought to him at his fish market by the appellant.,4
78,"At best, he said that they were the same type of shells.",4
78,We also observe that the testimony of the witness Mrs. Cummings pertaining to the cash market value of the shells in San Jacinto County is lacking in some essential requisites and that on another trial of this cause the knowledge and competency of this witness to testify to these facts should be more fully developed.,4
78,"Two points of error are presented, both complaining of the admission of evidence to the effect that appellant was taken by the officers to the stash and while under arrest he said that some of the beer was his.",4
78,We find no objection in the record on the ground that appellant’s statement was inadmissible because it was made while under arrest or without warning.,4
78,The evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction and we find no reversible error.,4
78,The testimony of the officers in the instant case is sufficient to directly connect appellant with the offense.,4
78,Appellant’s requested charge No. 1 would have instructed the jury that they could not convict appellant unless they found from the evidence that on the date in question appellant knew that women in the house were prostitutes and plying their trade at such location.,4
78,The question of lack of knowledge was not raised by the evidence as an affirmative defense and the court did not err in refusing to give the instruction.,4
78,Requested charge No. 3 would have instructed the jury that proof that a house bears the general reputation of a house of prostitution or general reputation of an inmate thereof as a common prostitute is not sufficient in itself to establish such as a fact.,4
78,Requested charge No. 4 would have instructed the jury to acquit appellant unless they found that on the date in question an occupant of the house did engage in acts of illegal sexual intercourse.,4
78,"There is no showing in the record what the answer of any venireman would have been, and there is nothing to show that any objectionable juror served on the jury, or that appellant exhausted his peremptory challenges, or that appellant was prejudiced because any juror had or did not have conscientious scruples against the infliction of death as a punishment for the crime of rape.",4
78,We have diligently reviewed the record.,4
78,We shall set forth all of the evidence adduced by both the state and the appellant with references to these prior convictions.,4
78,"While there may be merit in viewing this case from the standpoint of the admissibility or inadmissibility of the evidence relating to the prior convictions, as briefed by the appellant and the state, on the question of whether or not it was necessary to identify the appellant and the witness, we think that, properly, these prior convictions for the offense of vagrancy should be viewed and tested by the rules of admissibility of evidence showing prior convictions for offenses involving moral turpitude.",4
78,"The closest the state came to showing any subsection of the vagrancy statute was the reference by the witness Hamilton to the “pink complaint”, but the “pink complaint” was not entered in the evidence, and it is not before us.",4
78,"The line of questioning pursued by the state, at the time questions were being asked appellant and the witness Coleman, was framed in such manner as to elicit the desired and necessary information to show the subsection of the vagrancy statute, for the state did inquire if the judgment showed a conviction for the offense of vagrancy, to-wit: being then and there a common prostitute, and for the offense of vagrancy, to-wit: associating with and receiving aid from known prostitutes.",4
78,"These questions were actually suggestive, opinionated, conclusive questions, but they were answered in the negative.",4
78,No error appears in the admission of the written statement in evidence.,4
78,"We feel that the learned trial judge fell into error in admitting the various prior judgments of convictions without evidence to establish that appellant and his witness were the defendants therein and without first requiring the state to establish the subsection of the vagrancy statute under which they were had, in order to properly establish these offenses as ones properly coming within, the terms of the classification of offenses involving moral turpitude.",4
78,"Although the appellant’s counsel never at any time made a specific objection to the admissibility of the prior convictions for the offenses of vagrancy because they had not been shown to be ones involving moral turpitude, we think that the objections which were made to the prior judgments were sufficient to apprise the court of their admissibility.",4
78,"In view of our disposition of this case, we find it unnecessary to express an opinion upon the argument complained of by state’s counsel.",4
78,"Upon another trial, this incident will doubtless not arise.",4
78,"From what we have said, we feel that the effectiveness of the testimony of the appellant and the witness Coleman and its credibility was substantially lessened and that the appellant did suffer prejudicial harm by the admission of the various judgments showing prior convictions.",4
78,"While it is true that when the State introduces a confession containing exculpatory statements it is ordinarily incumbent upon the court to instruct the jury that the exculpatory statements are to be regarded as true unless disproved, this is not the rule where the accused testifies before the jury in accordance with such exculpatory statements, and his defensive theory is fairly submitted to the jury.",4
78,"They may look to all the evidence in the case, that offered by the appellant as well as that offered by the state, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offense charged.",4
78,The application of this rule to the facts in this case shows no error.,4
78,"The facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant the finding of the jury that the appellant shot the deceased with a gun, causing his death, and support the conviction.",4
78,"The trials being joined, we overrule the state’s contention that the statement of facts should not be considered because it is combined with the statement of facts in the other cases jointly tried.",4
78,"The evidence is deemed sufficient to sustain the conviction upon appellant’s plea of guilty, and we find no error.",4
78,"The remarks that “we don’t know that” and “the sole case for the defense has been a character witness,” and “this man was sworn in,” made in connection with argument relating to whether appellant in fact had an impediment in his speech, or which affected the way he walked, viewed in the light of the certification in the bills of exception, constituted an indirect reference to the appellant’s failure to testify and require reversal.",4
78,The fact that the trial judge sustained objection and instructed the jury to disregard a comment upon the defendant’s failure to testify did not cure the error.,4
78,"The sole ground for reversal relates to argument of counsel for the state to the effect that there was no evidence other than the testimony of the appellant that he had taken or was under the influence of a drug; that appellant produced some pills which he testified he had been taking, but no testimony that he told anyone that night, and that no one confirmed his testimony that he had taken the pills.",4
78,"The evidence admitted without objection shows that appellant conversed freely with the officers; stated that he had “had a little at his job”, when asked if he had been drinking; and when asked about the sign on the hood of his car, answered “What sign?”",4
78,The jury by their verdict resolved the disputed issues against appellant and we find the evidence sufficient to support their verdict.,4
78,Appellant relies upon the decisions by this Court which hold that in prosecutions of this nature it is the court’s duty to instruct the jury as to the causal connection between the accused’s intoxication and death of the deceased necessary to convict.,4
78,Under the evidence there was no issue raised that the cause of the collision and death of the deceaseds was entirely disconnected with appellant’s intoxication and therefore a defensive charge as to the causal connection was not required.,4
78,"The charge given by the court, under the evidence presented, was sufficient; hence no error is shown.",4
78,We have considered the informal bills of exception contained in the statement of facts and find no reversible error therein.,4
78,We have examined the record with care and fail to find any undisputed evidence which would render the confession inadmissible as a matter of law.,4
78,"We are unable to agree with the state’s contention that the indictment referred to in the question may have been that upon which appellant was on trial, rather than other indictments of which he had certified copies.",4
78,"The jury resolved the issues of fact, and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding.",4
78,"The court’s complete and exact instruction is of prime importance in a case of this nature, and there is no way of ascertaining what it was from the record before us.",4
78,"Appellant did not testify or offer any testimony in his behalf, and we find the evidence sufficient to support the conviction.",4
78,"We have carefully examined the questions complained about and find that the court sustained most of appellant’s objections and instructed the State to rephrase them, and we do not find an abuse of discretion in his rulings on the other questions.",4
78,"While it is true that the exhibits had been identified by another witness, in the absence of anything in the record to the contrary, we must be bound by the court’s qualification of the informal bill when he stated that they had not been exhibited to the jury as they were still in the sack.",4
78,"Be that as it may, we observe that the blood which was found on the seat covers was not of prosecutrix but came from appellant’s arm.",4
78,A careful reexamination of the statement of facts reveals that such an instruction was given in response to a request by appellant’s counsel.,4
78,"Remaining convinced that proper disposition was made of this cause on original submission, appellant’s motion for rehearing is overruled.",4
78,"Due to our disposition of the cause, the facts need not be set forth.",4
78,"In addition, the threats must be of such nature as would operate upon the mind of the prosecutrix to such an extent to cause her to yield to the attacker.",4
78,A careful and thorough examination of the record fails to reveal any evidence that would constitute proof of threats.,4
78,We feel that Longoria is distinguishable from the case at bar in that the evidence showed that one of the appellants stated: “This lady was scared and asked me if we were going to beat her up.,4
79,IT IS ORDERED that the Motion for Dismissal is Denied.,5
79,"Accordingly, it is the ruling of this court that all references to ""husband"", ""wife"", ""him"", and ""her"" in the Civil Code §139 are repealed, and that this statute should be read with the non-sex-based term ""a party"" wherever such terms are used.",5
79,The Court finds Mr. Cate could be held liable only for the April and May billings and the installation charge.,5
79,"This Court ruled at the hearing on October 9, 1979 and in one subsequent order on October 14, 1979 as to certain counts.",5

79,We have concluded that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and shall discuss the remaining contentions which we view as raising a substantial question.,5
79,"During the closing argument, the prosecutor said, “Bert Christesson is a gangster.",5

79,"Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.",5
79,"Appellant gave his age as 17, pleaded guilty and testified that the allegations of the indictment were true, and the trial judge found him guilty and assessed his punishment at 8 years.",5

79,The appeal is dismissed.,5
79,"The record has now been perfected, and the case is now properly before this Court for consideration.",5
79,We perceive no reversible error in the action of State’s counsel in withdrawing his objection to the witness testifying.,5
79,Nor do we agree that State’s counsel committed reversible error in his jury argument when he referred to the fact that the State had withdrawn its objection to Sullivan testifying and told the jury that appellant’s counsel could have placed Sullivan on the stand if he so desired.,5

79,"The trial court discharged the jury, after they had unanimously stated that they could not agree and thought it would be useless to continue to deliberate.",5
