The testimony of the state sufficiently shows that the appellant was guilty as charged.,4,Analysis

The surnames are not idem sonans and the state concedes that the variance is fatal.,4,Analysis

The overruling of the objection upon the ground “Conclusion and is repetition” was not error warranting reversal.,4,Analysis
The informal bills fail to reflect error.,4,Analysis
The indictment appears to be sufficient and the trial court did not err in overruling appellant’s motion to quash.,4,Analysis
The general trend of authority is against an interpretation of repeal by implication.,4,Analysis
The finding of the barbiturates and amphetamine in the cabin was a part of the search and of the res gestae and proof thereof was admissible.,4,Analysis
"The fact that he may have also had the intent, as the evidence clearly indicates, of forcing her to become a prostitute so that he might profit therefrom would in nowise preclude a prosecution for the first offense shown.",4,Analysis

Toombs also had a witness to corroborate his denial of intoxication.,4,Analysis
The efforts of an accused to induce a witness to testify falsely may be shown as indicating a consciousness of guilt.,4,Analysis
"The State’s proof shows that appellant, as an officer of the company, used the mohair in question for a purpose not authorized by Gee, the owner, in his consignment to the company and is sufficient to sustain appellant’s conviction under the statute for embezzlement of the mohair as charged in the indictment.",4,Analysis

"In making such proof, the entire letter was admissible, although it was not necessary to set out the letter in its entirety in the information.",4,Analysis
"In Bill No. 4, no certification is made that the argument set forth therein was not supported by the evidence, hence it cannot be appraised because no statement of facts accompanies the record.",4,Analysis
If this testimony presents error it was rendered harmless by the introduction of appellant’s written statement and the testimony of the accomplice that they took the calf out of the pasture.,4,Analysis
"However, the rule in this Court has been well established that the testimony of an accomplice witness together with the confession of the accused is sufficient to establish the corpus delicti.",4,Analysis
"However, here it seems clear that the trial court chose to ignore certain representations made in open court as to the terms of immediate payment upon the sale of the property in question.",4,Analysis
Failure to comply with the rules requiring the filing of briefs authorizes a dismissal of the appeal for the want of prosecution.,4,Analysis
"By such contention, appellant complains of the evidence admitted which showed that.he had attempted to procure the daughter, Glenda Wilhite, to engage in prostitution; that he was arrested on a charge of possession of barbiturates and was later arrested under a warrant in a peace bond proceeding.",4,Analysis
"Assuming that the objection was sufficient, the admission of the evidence showing that a pistol was found in the automobile is not ground for reversal, the record containing a stipulation that the pistol introduced in evidence was under the front seat and was loaded, and that it was removed from appellant’s car on the day in question; and appellant testified in regard to the two firearms he had in the car.",4,Analysis

"Appellant’s oral statement to Officer Geffert that he had the narcotics in his cabin which led to the officers finding the narcotic paraphernalia therein was admissible as an oral confession under the exception contained in Art: 727, supra, which reads, “* * * or, unless in connection with said confession he makes statements of facts or circumstances that are found to be true,",4,Analysis
"Appellant’s arrest for possession of barbiturates was clearly a part of the res gestae of the transaction with the prosecuting witness, and admissible as such.",4,Analysis
"Although credit was extended to Lewter Feed Lots, the fact remains that appellant and his companions obtained the property from the injured party by reason of the false pretext and representations made to him.",4,Analysis
"Also, the normal presumption that a seller of realty will require a mortgage or security agreement, made it necessary for the trial court to include such a mortgage requirement in its order to compel settlement.",4,Analysis

"The careful trial judge submitted the issue of self-defense and defense of another; the jury resolved what conflict there was in the evidence against appellant, and we find it sufficient to support the conviction.",4,Analysis
The burden was upon the state to prove that the letter was written and sent.,4,Analysis
"The appellant’s confession, coupled with evidence showing the commission of the crime, is sufficient.",4,Analysis
"The allegation in the information that appellant did “send and cause to be sent” the anonymous letter was in the language of the statute, Art. 1295, supra, and sufficient to allege the manner and means by which the offense was committed.",4,Analysis
Testimony read into the record is tantamount to the introduction in evidence of the documents from which the testimony was taken.,4,Analysis
"Such an instrument has not been approved by the trial court or by counsel for the State and appellant, and therefore cannot be considered under the terms of Article 759a, section 1(E), V.A.C.C.P.",4,Analysis

The admission of the testimony of the prosecutrix that appellant was trying to sexually attack her and that he had enormous strength and she had none does not present reversible error under the record.,4,Analysis
"So construing Art. 1404b P.C. before and after its amendment in 1955, we overrule appellant’s contention that the statute is void.",4,Analysis
"In Thurman, supra, two state’s witnesses testified that they did not get close enough to the appellant to smell his breath; neither testified that he was intoxicated.",4,Analysis
