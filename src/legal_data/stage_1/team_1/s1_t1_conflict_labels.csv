"This appeal concerns the revocation of appellant's release on bail by the Superior Court on October 24, 1975.","Facts, Issue"
"No indictment or information has been filed against the appellant, and there is nothing to show that any condition of release has been willfully violated by the defendant.","Facts, Conclusion"
"The October 24, 1975 revocation of defendant’s release on bail is reversed, and the defendant is ordered released on the same conditions as previously existed, with the additional condition that he stay at his parents' house and observe a curfew between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"

"observe that the Court expressly provided that it did not adopt as a constitutional standard the ""utterly without redeeming social value"" test (cf. part (c) of the Miller test), incorporated in part three of the test articulated in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 86 S. Ct. 975, 977 (1966), and provided in §28.45(a)(3) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code.","Facts, Analysis"
"A year after Miller was decided, in Hamling v. United States, 94 S. Ct. 2887 (1974), the Court was presented with the question of whether its rejection of the third part of the Memoirs test and its revision in Miller indicated that the Memoirs formulation was determined to be unconstitutionally vague.","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
Memoirs was not rejected because it was so vague as to deprive criminal defendants of adequate notice but because it represented a departure from prior definitions of obscenity,"Facts, Analysis"
"In Marks v. United States, 97 S. Ct. 990 (1977), referring to the third part of the Memoirs test the Court added that ""clearly it was thought that some conduct which would have gone unpunished under Memoirs would result in conviction under Miller.""","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Because of this, the Court reasoned that they were entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it found that the materials involved in the charge were, in accordance with the Memoirs standard, ""utterly without redeeming social value.""","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Because the tantamount language ""utterly without redeeming social importance"" is expressly a part of the Guam statute, the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in Marks, to instruct the jury on this standard.","Facts, Analysis"
"With receipt of the above instructions, the jury was sufficiently appraised of the more restrictive burden on the government than that required by Miller.","Facts, Analysis"
"In Miller and Handing, the Court reiterated its pronouncement in Roth v. United States, 77 S. Ct. 1304 (1957):","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
The Court in Hamling reconfirmed its renunciation of a rigid standard:,"Facts, Invalid sentences"
Appellant also contends that judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the Miller specificity requirements does not rectify the statute's unconstitutionality.,"Facts, Issue"
"The rationale for this proposition is that the Miller Court had included in its opinion language to the effect that""... existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.""","Facts, Issue"
"Appellant argues that this reference to statutes ""existing"" at the time Miller was decided precludes judicial construction of statutes passed after the decision, and therefore Guam's statute, which had been passed approximately three years after Miller, is not capable of being ""saved"" by judicial construction.","Facts, Issue"
"It is evident that the Court felt existing state obscenity laws which were otherwise constitutionally valid would continue to be valid, either as written or construed, in the indeterminate future.","Facts, Conclusion"
"We find that it would be inconsistent with notions of due process, and therefore inconceivable as in inference, to interpret the Court's meaning to be that an obscenity statute currently active in a State's law may or may not be constitutional, depending solely on whether it was enacted prior to or after the decision in Miller.","Facts, Conclusion"
"While we acknowledge that the language of the Guam statute is in large part archaic, we do not find that it is on that basis alone unconstitutional.","Facts, Conclusion"
"In an alternative context, appellant contends that even if judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the specificity requirements is valid, such construction does not cure the constitutional defect as applied to appellant.","Facts, Issue"
"This contention is premised on the proposition that the Guam statute is facially defective, a proposition with which we are not in agreement.","Facts, Issue"

"The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest.","Facts, Issue"
"The question that must first be answered is whether the phraseology ""obscene act"" and obscene exhibition of his (sic) body"" was sufficient as notice to appellant that her conduct was proscribed.","Facts, Issue"
Only if it was not does the issue of statutory construction as applied to appellant's conduct become viable for review.,"Facts, Analysis"
"655, 446 P.2d 535 (1968), cited by appellant in support of her argument, is inapposite to the current state of the law regarding ""contemporary community standards.""","Facts, Analysis"
"Neither expert testimony on community standards, Hamling v. United States, supra at 2912-2914, nor instructions on precisely what ""community"" to consider, Jenkings v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 157 (1974), are constitutionally required.","Facts, Analysis"
Further the possibility that different juries might reach different conclusions as to the same material does not render a statute unconstitutional.,"Facts, Analysis"
"Regarding the ""contemporary community standards"" to be applied in judging appellant's conduct, the trial judge charged the jury as follows:","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"We hold that this charge to the jury was sufficient and proper, and find no merit in appellant's attack on the failure of the Government to produce evidence of the community standards of Guam.","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
Appellant's final contention is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not appellant violated Guam's obscenity law.,"Facts, Issue"
We also recognize that it is probable that appellant had not completed,"Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"The third criterion of Section 28.45(a) is that the performance must be ""utterly without redeeming social importance.""","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"We emphasize that the performance must not only have social importance to be constitutionally protected, but that the social importance must be sufficient to redeem the obscene, or unprotected part of the performance.","Facts, Analysis"
"Thus, even if appellant's performance opened with a Shakespearean recitation and climaxed with an aria from the ""Barber of Seville,"" a jury could nevertheless have found that, notwithstanding whatever social importance was gleaned from the entire performance, it was insufficient to redeem the obscene act or exhibition.","Facts, Analysis"
"When the verdict of a jury is challenged, the general rule of applicability is that its verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Based on the evidence before it, the jury could have inferred that the appellant's performance would have been obscene irrespective of its context, and returned a verdict of guilty based on that inference.","Facts, Analysis"
"Because of this, we are not inclined to disturb the verdict as rendered.","Facts, Analysis"
The judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.,"Facts, Conclusion"
"See, for example, J. Harlan's separate opinion in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 88 S. Ct. 1298 (1968), wherein he expressed that the ""intractable obscenity problem"" had led to ""a variety of views among the members of the Court unmatched in any other course of constitutional adjudication.""","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"

"When circumstances of production, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material or a performance is being exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal, evidence of such circumstances is admissible in a prosecution under this article upon the upon question whether the material or performance is utterly without redeeming social importance.","Facts, Analysis"
Neither the prosecution nor the defense shall be required to introduce expert witness testimony concerning the obscene character of the material,"Facts, Conclusion"

"The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (citations omitted); (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a","Facts, Issue"

This is an interlocutory appeal after the Trial Court granted Defendant's motion to suppress a firearm which was seized after a search warrant was issued for the search of Defendant's house.,"Facts, Issue"
"The Trial Court granted the motion to suppress on the grounds that (1) they made by the ""CRI"" was not a supervised buy about which Officer Klinge was competent to testify from firsthand knowledge and (2) there was not presented sufficient showing that the ""CRI"" was reliable.","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"When the affidavit is not based on direct personal observation of the affiant, the judge issuing the search warrant must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concludes that the informant is credible or his information reliable.","Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Be that as it may, this does not alter the original information presented to the issuing magistrate.","Facts, Conclusion"
The Trial Court did not find (nor is there anything in the record to so indicate) that there is a false statement in the affidavit or testimony of Officer Klinge or that Klinge demonstrated reckless disregard for the truth which would require an evidentiary hearing.,"Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
There is a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant.,"Facts, Others"
"If, after setting aside any material that is the subject of the charge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth, there is sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, an evidentiary hearing is not even required.","Facts, Conclusion"

"Appellants' claim for relief is based on a 1972 Three-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides that all off-island teachers whose performance had been rated satisfactory would be offered similar reemployment by March 1 of the teacher's termination year, so long as the government of Guam policies provide for such hiring of teachers .","Facts, Issue"
on round-trip contracts.,"Facts, Others"
"There is no question that all of the appellants had performed satisfactorily as teachers; however, their contracts were not renewed in a timely manner.","Facts, Conclusion"
The trial judge's dismissal of the complaint was based on a sovereign immunity defense.,"Facts, Analysis"
The Organic Act of Guam empowers the local legislature to waive sovereign immunity in tort and contract actions against the Government to the extent which it deems desirable.,"Facts, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Appellants contend that the notice requirements under the Claims Act were substantially complied with because plaintiffs followed the grievance procedures contained in Article IV of the 1972 Collective Bargaining Agreement, thus giving the Government at least indirect notice of their desire to bring suit.","Facts, Issue"
"However, no cases have been offered to support this novel theory of constructive notice, and, as the authority cited by the appellee makes clear, the jurisdictional requirements of government claims statutes must be strictly followed.","Facts, Analysis"
Appellants also argue that the sovereign immunity doctrine does not prevent litigants from seeking equitable relief compelling government officials to perform their duties properly (in this case requiring the Department of Education to issue contracts which become effective retroactively with full pay).,"Facts, Issue"
It is clear that sovereign immunity applies to specific performance actions against the Government; otherwise the government cannot operate effectively if its every act is subject to injunctive actions.,"Facts, Analysis"
Appellant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of presenting an obscene performance by parting her vulva with her hands while lying down on stage in violation of §28.50 of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code [9 GCA].,"Issue, Facts"
"Here none of the conditions enumerated in Sections 40.65, 40.70 and 40.75 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code were present; thus the better course would have been for the Government to prepare an Order to Show Cause with timely notice of hearing, so that a complete and effective record could be prepared.","Rule/Law/Holding, Analysis"
"Our reading of §28.45 and §28.50 in the light of the Court's statements in Roth, 12 200-ft. Reels and Hamling leads us to conclude that, although the language of the Guam obscenity statue is at variance with the guidelines set out verbatim in Miller, the language is sufficiently specific under Miller as to be absent of any constitutional defect.","Rule/Law/Holding, Conclusion"
"Nevertheless, a review and disposition of whether §28.45 and §28.50 are unconstitutional as applied to the specific conduct of appellant is appropriate here.","Rule/Law/Holding, Conclusion"
It is notable that even appellant concedes that the Guam statute does forbid the presentation of an obscene performance (appellant's brief at p.5).,"Rule/Law/Holding, Analysis"
"Accordingly, we conclude that the language of §28.45 and §28.50, and particularly that language of §28.50(y), gave adequate notice to appellant that her conduct was within the prohibition of the statute.","Rule/Law/Holding, Conclusion"
"Although the Government tried to argue that the Complaint filed against the accused was sufficient for the Superior Court to have revoked his bail, Section 1.17 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code clearly states that an information may not be filed until there has been a preliminary examination and an order holding defendant to answer under Section 45.80.","Analysis, Rule/Law/Holding"
"While the Superior Court might have had the power to automatically revoke the defendant's release on bail if the above conditions had been satisfied, the record makes it clear that the Superior Court based its revocation on the mere fact that a complaint had been filed.","Analysis, Conclusion"
"No where in the Guam Criminal Procedure Code does the mere filing of a complaint empower the court to take such action, and the Superior Court must be charged with uniformly applying all section of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code.","Analysis, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Also, it seems that appellant's counsel was not given adequate notice and time to prepare for a hearing on the revocation of his client's bail.","Analysis, Conclusion"
"Certainly, minimum standards of due process require at least a few hours notice so that counsel may intelligently protect his client's rights.","Analysis, Rule/Law/Holding"
"Upon review of appellant's contentions, we find no basis for reversal, and accordingly AFFIRM the judgment of the trial court.","Analysis, Conclusion"
"We note first that obscenity can manifest itself in conduct as well as through means of verbal and pictorial expression, Kaplan v. California, 93 S. Ct. 2680, 2683-2684 (1973), and that States have greater power to regulate nonverbal, physical conduct than to suppress depictions or descriptions of the same behavior.","Analysis, Rule/Law/Holding"
We also recognize that the search for guidance in separating unprotected obscenity from other sexually oriented but constitutionally protected forms of expression has historically been one of the more difficult tasks of reviewing courts.,"Analysis, Rule/Law/Holding"
We now turn to appellant's contention that Guam's obscenity statute fails to comply with the specificity requirements of Miller v. California and is therefore unconstitutional on its face.,"Analysis, Issue"
"The second part (part (b)) of the Miller guidelines for the trier of fact in determining what is patently offensive is ""whether","Analysis, Invalid sentences"
Appellant argues that the examples set forth in Miller describe sexual conduct while the Guam statute does not provide any definition or any example of what forms of sexual conduct are being regulated.,"Analysis, Issue"
"While there can be no question that Miller requires sexual conduct to be specifically defined by the applicable law, we believe that appellant misconceives the exactitude with which such specificity is to be defined.","Analysis, Conclusion"
"We find that the language of the statute provided appellant with adequate notice of the illegality of her conduct, and that therefore it is not incumbent upon us to reach the propounded issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional as construed to apply to appellant’s conduct.","Analysis, Conclusion"
"The use of the terminology ""obscene act"" and ""obscene exhibition"" is therefore sufficiently definite in legal meaning as to have provided appellant with notice of the charge against her.","Analysis, Conclusion"
Appellant's next contention is that the evidence presented against her at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction in that the Government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam.,"Analysis, Issue"
We find that they were and we reverse the Order granting the motion to suppress.,"Analysis, Conclusion"
The testimony before the Judge issuing the search was in a little more detail about the controlled buy at Rico's.,"Analysis, Facts"
"The Government Code of Guam, §§6500.00 et seq, provides for such waiver and §6500.05 of the Claims Act requires that all claims against the Government must be filed within six months from the date the claim arose.","Analysis, Rule/Law/Holding"
