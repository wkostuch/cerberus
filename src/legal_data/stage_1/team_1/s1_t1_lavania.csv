Massachusetts, 86 S. Ct. 975, 977 (1966), and provided in §28.45(a)(3) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code.",1,Facts
320,"A year after Miller was decided, in Hamling v. United States, 94 S. Ct. 2887 (1974), the Court was presented with the question of whether its rejection of the third part of the Memoirs test and its revision in Miller indicated that the Memoirs formulation was determined to be unconstitutionally vague.",1,Facts
321,Memoirs was not rejected because it was so vague as to deprive criminal defendants of adequate notice but because it represented a departure from prior definitions of obscenity,1,Facts
322,"In Marks v. United States, 97 S. Ct. 990 (1977), referring to the third part of the Memoirs test the Court added that ""clearly it was thought that some conduct which would have gone unpunished under Memoirs would result in conviction under Miller.""",1,Facts
324,The petitioners in Marks were indicted for conduct occurring prior to the decision in Miller.,1,Facts
325,"Because of this, the Court reasoned that they were entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it found that the materials involved in the charge were, in accordance with the Memoirs standard, ""utterly without redeeming social value.""",1,Facts
326,"Because the tantamount language ""utterly without redeeming social importance"" is expressly a part of the Guam statute, the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in Marks, to instruct the jury on this standard.",1,Facts

337,The Court in Hamling reconfirmed its renunciation of a rigid standard:,1,Facts
339,Appellant also contends that judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the Miller specificity requirements does not rectify the statute's unconstitutionality.,1,Facts
340,"The rationale for this proposition is that the Miller Court had included in its opinion language to the effect that""... existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.""",1,Facts
342,"Appellant argues that this reference to statutes ""existing"" at the time Miller was decided precludes judicial construction of statutes passed after the decision, and therefore Guam's statute, which had been passed approximately three years after Miller, is not capable of being ""saved"" by judicial construction.",1,Facts
343,"It is evident that the Court felt existing state obscenity laws which were otherwise constitutionally valid would continue to be valid, either as written or construed, in the indeterminate future.",1,Facts
344,"We find that it would be inconsistent with notions of due process, and therefore inconceivable as in inference, to interpret the Court's meaning to be that an obscenity statute currently active in a State's law may or may not be constitutional, depending solely on whether it was enacted prior to or after the decision in Miller.",1,Facts
345,"While we acknowledge that the language of the Guam statute is in large part archaic, we do not find that it is on that basis alone unconstitutional.",1,Facts
346,"In an alternative context, appellant contends that even if judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the specificity requirements is valid, such construction does not cure the constitutional defect as applied to appellant.",1,Facts
347,"This contention is premised on the proposition that the Guam statute is facially defective, a proposition with which we are not in agreement.",1,Facts

392,id she do anything else?,1,Facts
350,"The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest.",1,Facts
351,"The question that must first be answered is whether the phraseology ""obscene act"" and obscene exhibition of his (sic) body"" was sufficient as notice to appellant that her conduct was proscribed.",1,Facts
352,Only if it was not does the issue of statutory construction as applied to appellant's conduct become viable for review.,1,Facts
358,"655, 446 P.2d 535 (1968), cited by appellant in support of her argument, is inapposite to the current state of the law regarding ""contemporary community standards.""",1,Facts

364,"We hold that this charge to the jury was sufficient and proper, and find no merit in appellant's attack on the failure of the Government to produce evidence of the community standards of Guam.",1,Facts
365,Appellant's final contention is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not appellant violated Guam's obscenity law.,1,Facts
367,"The Government's witness, Mr. Duran, admitted he did not see appellant's entire performance since he entered the Sandy You club after appellant had begun her dance.",1,Facts
368,We also recognize that it is probable that appellant had not completed,1,Facts
369,"From this admittedly partially-observed performance, appellant argues that it was impossible for Duran to describe appellant's entire performance to the jury and therefore, it was impossible for the jury to determine whether the performance, as a whole, was in fact obscene.",1,Facts
370,"The third criterion of Section 28.45(a) is that the performance must be ""utterly without redeeming social importance.""",1,Facts
371,"We emphasize that the performance must not only have social importance to be constitutionally protected, but that the social importance must be sufficient to redeem the obscene, or unprotected part of the performance.",1,Facts
372,"Thus, even if appellant's performance opened with a Shakespearean recitation and climaxed with an aria from the ""Barber of Seville,"" a jury could nevertheless have found that, notwithstanding whatever social importance was gleaned from the entire performance, it was insufficient to redeem the obscene act or exhibition.",1,Facts
375,"When the verdict of a jury is challenged, the general rule of applicability is that its verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.",1,Facts
378,"Based on the evidence before it, the jury could have inferred that the appellant's performance would have been obscene irrespective of its context, and returned a verdict of guilty based on that inference.",1,Facts

316,"The constitutional standards provided in Miller and its attendant cases are those which are applicable to the issues raised in this appeal, and it is on this basis that we proceed in our review of appellant's contentions.",4,Analysis
330,We now turn to appellant's contention that Guam's obscenity statute fails to comply with the specificity requirements of Miller v. California and is therefore unconstitutional on its face.,4,Analysis
331,"The second part (part (b)) of the Miller guidelines for the trier of fact in determining what is patently offensive is ""whether",4,Analysis
332,Appellant argues that the examples set forth in Miller describe sexual conduct while the Guam statute does not provide any definition or any example of what forms of sexual conduct are being regulated.,4,Analysis
333,"While there can be no question that Miller requires sexual conduct to be specifically defined by the applicable law, we believe that appellant misconceives the exactitude with which such specificity is to be defined.",4,Analysis
353,"We find that the language of the statute provided appellant with adequate notice of the illegality of her conduct, and that therefore it is not incumbent upon us to reach the propounded issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional as construed to apply to appellant’s conduct.",4,Analysis
354,"The use of the terminology ""obscene act"" and ""obscene exhibition"" is therefore sufficiently definite in legal meaning as to have provided appellant with notice of the charge against her.",4,Analysis
356,Appellant's next contention is that the evidence presented against her at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction in that the Government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam.,4,Analysis
489,We find that they were and we reverse the Order granting the motion to suppress.,4,Analysis
490,The testimony before the Judge issuing the search was in a little more detail about the controlled buy at Rico's.,4,Analysis
536,"The Government Code of Guam, §§6500.00 et seq, provides for such waiver and §6500.05 of the Claims Act requires that all claims against the Government must be filed within six months from the date the claim arose.",4,Analysis
537,There is no question that appellants' claims were not filed within this time period and that no information was supplied to the Attorney General as outlined in §6500.03 of the Act.,4,Analysis
298,"In a July 19, 1979 Opinion, the District Court determined that a three-judge panel is not required to hear appeals relating to bail hearings.",5,Conclusion
328,"Accordingly, we find that appellant suffered no loss by use of the ""social importance"" standard in §§28.45(a)(3) and 28.45(c) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code.",5,Conclusion
486,Petition to terminate is GRANTED.,5,Conclusion
551,"Having read the Opinion in this appeal, I hereby concur with the result reached by the Superior Court's dismissal of plaintiff's action for failure to comply with the Government of Guam Claims Act be affirmed.",5,Conclusion
