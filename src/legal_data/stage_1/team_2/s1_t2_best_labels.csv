The uncontradicted testimony of Root and Reyes suggest that the right to confront and produce witnesses was limited when their cases were heard.,4,Analysis
"Thus, the bare fact that compensation to plaintiff under the Worlonen's Compensation Law would come from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund is sufficient to bar plaintiff's claim under Government Code ¬ß37005.",4,Analysis

"Obviously prison administrators have great discretion in supervising prisoners; however, it is only when a prisoner's actions might reasonably endanger prison security or the safety of the public in general, that a prisoner's vested rights may be temporarily suspended prior to a full and adequate hearing.",4,Analysis
"This is not to minimize the seriousness of the offenses charged; however, benefits afforded a prisoner on a work-release program are similar to those of a prisoner on parole, thus requiring greater rights to a hearing than might normally be associated with general prison discipline and administrative procedures.",4,Analysis
"If plaintiff is not an employee of the Government of Guam, then ¬ß37005 is no bar to this action.",4,Analysis

It would seem inequitable for this court to bind defendant to the two (2) month requirement for response when due in part to clerical error by the clerk the summons was served in a defective state.,4,Analysis

Too often grand juries are criticized for being mere rubber stamps of the prosecution.,4,Analysis
"This was proper and appropriate, for, although such a defense is normally barred by Rules of Civil Procedure 8(c) if not pleaded, the defendant may, nonetheless, take advantage of the plaintiff's proof, and, if necessary, the court will raise the issue itself.",4,Analysis

It therefore appears that Mr. Cate would not be liable for any of the present judgment.,4,Analysis
"Thus, it is required in Guam that a transcript be made and that copies be provided for both the prosecuting attorney and each defendant.",4,Analysis
The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants.,4,Analysis
"Granted, we are not able to say with any certitude that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these discussions.",4,Analysis
Off-the-record discussions may lend credence to such criticism.,4,Analysis
The language of the court in Pipes is equally appropriate to the matter now on appeal before this Court.,4,Analysis
"Further, while we are not aware of the nature of the off-the-record discussions, we find it necessary to add that, although it is the role of the prosecutor to draw such indictments as the grand jury directs, he may not give advice as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in any matter, nor may he in any way seek to influence the grand jury to find or not to find any indictment, nor may he take part in any of the grand jury's deliberations, as these are all matters wholly within the exclusive province of the grand jury.",4,Analysis

"But we are not willing to speculate that they were not, nor should a defendant be asked to guess and be burdened with proving that he was.",4,Analysis
"Plaintiff, on oral argument, stated that the challenged documents were submitted for the purpose of estopping the Government from asserting as a defense the untimely filing of plaintiff's claim and action.",4,Analysis
This Court finds that Rule 408 creates an exception for the admissibility of evidence otherwise inadmissible if offered for purposes other than to prove liability.,4,Analysis
"Plaintiff does not seek to establish that the documents of compromise are an admission of liability on the part of the Government, but merely that negotiations were ongoing they are admissible.",4,Analysis
"With regard to the Best Evidence argument, where an original is unobtainable, or within the control of the party opponent, the Rule creates an exception for the introduction of copy in lieu of the original.",4,Analysis
"Based on the foregoing, this Court finds no ground to strike the documents as submitted by plaintiff, and accordingly DENIES the Government's motion.",4,Analysis
