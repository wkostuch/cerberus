"However, Government Code §21502 is, at first blush, ambiguous.",4,Analysis
"If the Guam Power Authority is ""autonomous"" as set forth in §21502, how can an agency relationship exist between it and the Government of Guam?",4,Analysis
"Yet, the same §21502 sets forth that the Guam Power Authority is an ""instrumentality"" of the Government of Guam.",4,Analysis

"Although the Fund may recoup these payments from the Authority on an annual basis pursuant to this Section, the liability for Workmen's Compensation payments is upon the Government of Guam.",4,Analysis
The uncontradicted testimony of Root and Reyes suggest that the right to confront and produce witnesses was limited when their cases were heard.,4,Analysis
"Thus, the bare fact that compensation to plaintiff under the Worlonen's Compensation Law would come from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund is sufficient to bar plaintiff's claim under Government Code §37005.",4,Analysis
"This Section does not, therefore, override the specific provisions of Government Code 37005 that make the Workmen's Compensation Law the exclusive remedy against the Government of Guam in some cases.",4,Analysis
"Obviously prison administrators have great discretion in supervising prisoners; however, it is only when a prisoner's actions might reasonably endanger prison security or the safety of the public in general, that a prisoner's vested rights may be temporarily suspended prior to a full and adequate hearing.",4,Analysis
"This is not to minimize the seriousness of the offenses charged; however, benefits afforded a prisoner on a work-release program are similar to those of a prisoner on parole, thus requiring greater rights to a hearing than might normally be associated with general prison discipline and administrative procedures.",4,Analysis
"If plaintiff is not an employee of the Government of Guam, then §37005 is no bar to this action.",4,Analysis
"However, assuming that these sections apply to the petitioners, it would seem that the Director conversely has no authority to remove prisoners from the Halfway House Correctional Facility without the express approval of the parole board.",4,Analysis
"There is no question that the petitioners' rights guaranteed under Wolff v. McDonnel, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct.",4,Analysis

"2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and its progeny (e.g. Durso v. Rowe, supra) were ignored by the Director of Corrections.",4,Analysis
It would seem inequitable for this court to bind defendant to the two (2) month requirement for response when due in part to clerical error by the clerk the summons was served in a defective state.,4,Analysis
"In some cases the gravity of certain offenses could justify the disciplinary removal of a prisoner from work release prior to a full hearing; however, no exigent circumstances to justify such removal have been shown by the Government to exist in the cases at bar.",4,Analysis

"1 During the course of the trial, the plaintiff's proof having established that plaintiff was within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident, the court itself raised the issue of whether or not this action was barred under the Workmen's compensation Law, Government Code Sections 37000 et.",4,Analysis
Too often grand juries are criticized for being mere rubber stamps of the prosecution.,4,Analysis
"This was proper and appropriate, for, although such a defense is normally barred by Rules of Civil Procedure 8(c) if not pleaded, the defendant may, nonetheless, take advantage of the plaintiff's proof, and, if necessary, the court will raise the issue itself.",4,Analysis
"Thus, even if §139 were found to be void as urged, there is a basis for the award of child support.",4,Analysis

"Although plaintiff has no record of the cancellation the testimony received indicates that a record of the cancellation might not have been made or if made, might have been destroyed.",4,Analysis
It therefore appears that Mr. Cate would not be liable for any of the present judgment.,4,Analysis
"Thus, it is required in Guam that a transcript be made and that copies be provided for both the prosecuting attorney and each defendant.",4,Analysis
The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants.,4,Analysis
"Granted, we are not able to say with any certitude that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these discussions.",4,Analysis
Off-the-record discussions may lend credence to such criticism.,4,Analysis
The language of the court in Pipes is equally appropriate to the matter now on appeal before this Court.,4,Analysis
"Further, while we are not aware of the nature of the off-the-record discussions, we find it necessary to add that, although it is the role of the prosecutor to draw such indictments as the grand jury directs, he may not give advice as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in any matter, nor may he in any way seek to influence the grand jury to find or not to find any indictment, nor may he take part in any of the grand jury's deliberations, as these are all matters wholly within the exclusive province of the grand jury.",4,Analysis
"The Government further contends that such documents are hearsay, violate the Best Evidence Rule, and are not properly authenticated.",4,Analysis
"But we are not willing to speculate that they were not, nor should a defendant be asked to guess and be burdened with proving that he was.",4,Analysis
"Plaintiff, on oral argument, stated that the challenged documents were submitted for the purpose of estopping the Government from asserting as a defense the untimely filing of plaintiff's claim and action.",4,Analysis
This Court finds that Rule 408 creates an exception for the admissibility of evidence otherwise inadmissible if offered for purposes other than to prove liability.,4,Analysis
"Plaintiff does not seek to establish that the documents of compromise are an admission of liability on the part of the Government, but merely that negotiations were ongoing they are admissible.",4,Analysis
"With regard to the Best Evidence argument, where an original is unobtainable, or within the control of the party opponent, the Rule creates an exception for the introduction of copy in lieu of the original.",4,Analysis
"Based on the foregoing, this Court finds no ground to strike the documents as submitted by plaintiff, and accordingly DENIES the Government's motion.",4,Analysis
"This Court believes that the order of September 11th clearly circumvents this argument, and that said order is an unconditional prohibition upon the Government from using any information relating to questions not properly answered.",4,Analysis
"IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendant's motion to quash is DENIED, and that defendant file an answer herein with 30 days of this order.",5,Conclusion
The case cited by plaintiff in this regard are unpersuasive.,5,Conclusion
"This being the case, the Government of Guam cannot, as a matter of law, be a third party with respect to plaintiff.",5,Conclusion
"Accordingly, it is the ruling of this court that all references to ""husband"", ""wife"", ""him"", and ""her"" in the Civil Code §139 are repealed, and that this statute should be read with the non-sex-based term ""a party"" wherever such terms are used.",5,Conclusion
