1583,"Where no inconsistency strong enough to evoke a repeal exists, a repeal by implication will not be found.",4,Analysis
1584,It cannot be presumed that the legislature intended to undo or repeal an act to which it had but just assigned a valid function.,4,Analysis

1591,"In the absence of an irreconcilable conflict, or where two provisions of legislation are so clearly repugnant as to vital matters which they relate, courts should construe all acts harmoniously where such construction is reasonably possible.",4,Analysis
1595,A suit filed under the Claims Act is a very narrow and limited area for relief.,4,Analysis
1596,The Government consents to be sued only as provided in the Act. It can not be easily construed in the absence of express language that the adoption of §680.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure necessarily implied a repeal of §6500.15 of the Government Code.,4,Analysis
1604,"The Court fears, however, that this procedure would not necessarily solve defendant's problem.",4,Analysis

1634,"However, common law rules of interpretation state that the repeal of a repealing statute operates to revive the original enactment where the repeal of the repealing statute is accomplished by express provision without additional legislation on the subject matter.",4,Analysis
1636,It is the opinion of this Court that §6500.13 was revived by §6 of P.L.,4,Analysis

1676,"The filing and recordation of the Notice of Levying on Real Property in the Department of Land Management, Government of Guam, creates a lien on the property of the defendants.",4,Analysis
1681,The Court is of the opinion that he foregoing Order involves a controlling issue of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the Order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.,4,Analysis
1691,"Such a position does not take, into account Government Code §6500.20, which specifically allows ""further proceedings against the employee"" if ""the Court certifies that it would have awarded the claimant more but for the limitations of 6500.13.""",4,Analysis
1700,"Guam's Government Claims Act differs from those of many other jurisdictions, for while the act waives the sovereign immunity of the territory, it does not indemnify or immunize the employee.",4,Analysis
1701,"Rather, it provides that judgment or settlement of a government claims action bars further action against the employee (6500.20).",4,Analysis
1702,"Further, the Act only covers negligent torts, and sovereign immunity is not waived for intentional wrongs of the employee.",4,Analysis
1705,This reading of §6500.10 reaches an absurd result.,4,Analysis
1706,The legislature has made the determination that it will make it possible to proceed against the territory rather than the employee on negligence claims.,4,Analysis
1707,Thus employees are freed to some extent from concern about individual liability which make them overly cautious about their actions being found negligent and adversely affect their function as employees.,4,Analysis
1708,The legislature determined that a similar rationale did not exist for intentional wrong doing by government employees.,4,Analysis
1709,Yet the reading of §6500.10 urged by defendants is that simply by plaintiff's' act of filing a claim with the government for alleged negligence an employee is completely immunized should it turn out that the act was intentional.,4,Analysis
1710,"Thus the act would provide absolute protection for an intentional tort-feasor, while providing a recovery against no one, and would indemnify a negligent tort-feasor to the extent of $100,000.",4,Analysis
1711,"This is a very strange result, and there is no indication that this was the intent of the legislature.",4,Analysis
1712,"Beyond creating a chilling effect on filing a claim with the government because a plaintiff would lose all should he be mistaken in his theory, this reading also creates troublesome due process problems as such an irrevocable election would have to e made before the plaintiff has the opportunity for any sort of discovery.",4,Analysis
1713,"The election would have to be made before the filing of claim, let alone a law suit.",4,Analysis
1718,"The basis of this motion is that this cause of action for negligent hiring, training and supervision of the defendant employees is not within the scope of the claim filed by plaintiff, and thus barred.",4,Analysis
1720,"The claim is for ""all injuries proximately caused by the negligence... of the Government of Guam, its officers and employees, for injuries arising out of the wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment of claimant.. .said wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment having occurred on May 1, 1976, and May 2, 1976.""",4,Analysis
1724,"But in Kauss summary judgment was granted where a plaintiff filed a claim for intentional acts, and later a complaint for negligence.",4,Analysis
1725,Here there is no question that the claim and complaint sound in negligence.,4,Analysis
1726,"The question is whether the claim is too broad, rather than too narrow as in Kauss.",4,Analysis
1727,"The notice of claim is not a pleading, neither is it a trap for the unwary.",4,Analysis
1728,"The claimant is not required to list his theories of recovery, but rather the facts which lead to liability.",4,Analysis
1729,The Court notes that such a claim may often be prepared by a lay person of limited education.,4,Analysis
1730,"If the claim gives such facts as would enable the Government to investigate its liability, it should be judged sufficient.",4,Analysis
1731,The government has all the tools of any civil suit to refine the plaintiff's theory before trial.,4,Analysis
1746,"Even though there were no guards or steel bars to detain the defendant, the totality of the circumstance confirms that this was custodial interrogation.",4,Analysis
1752,"The merits as to the actual rights and obligation between the buyers and sellers are not subject of this appeal; the only issue before us is whether the January 8, 1979 Order of the Superior Court purporting to enforce a settlement agreement made to the court by the parties during trial was error.",4,Analysis
1753,"First, we have determined that the defendants-appellants may prosecute this appeal independently of any partnership agreement which it might have with other defendants.",4,Analysis
1760,"While it is true that the question of a mortgage was never discussed by the parties in open court, it seems very unlikely that any party would contemplate transferring over an interest in realty without an adequate security interest.",4,Analysis
1761,"In the normal course of business dealings, a mortgage or some similar security interest would be expected, and it is the opinion of this Court that granting a mortgage in favor of the defendants would do less violence to the intention of the parties, while at the same time protecting defendant's equitable interests in the property which it was conveying.",4,Analysis
1763,"However, here it seems clear that the trial court chose to ignore certain representations made in open court as to the terms of immediate payment upon the sale of the property in question.",4,Analysis
1764,"Also, the normal presumption that a seller of realty will require a mortgage or security agreement, made it necessary for the trial court to include such a mortgage requirement in its order to compel settlement.",4,Analysis
1529,The Court finds §17402 of the Government Code of Guam to be an unconstitutional infringement upon a citizen's First Amendment right to freedom of speech.,5,Conclusion
1573,"That all permitted signs are illegal per se if not in English or Chamorro or without a translation into either, is contradictory to the most basic right of a democratic society - the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.",5,Conclusion
1574,This case is hereby dismissed.,5,Conclusion

1680,It is further ORDERED that plaintiff pay to defendants their costs.,5,Conclusion
