106,The admission of the testimony of the prosecutrix that appellant was trying to sexually attack her and that he had enormous strength and she had none does not present reversible error under the record.,4,Analysis

106,The amended statute was in effect on the date the indictment alleged the second conviction was had.,4,Analysis
106,"The appellant’s confession, coupled with evidence showing the commission of the crime, is sufficient.",4,Analysis

106,"The claimant is not required to list his theories of recovery, but rather the facts which lead to liability.",4,Analysis
106,"The complaint must be considered in light of the fact that the witness had testified that he was not friendly with appellant and carried no good feeling or will toward him “not a bit in this world”, and that appellant had asked the witness if it was not a fact that he was mad at the appellant because he had brought a law suit against him for false arrest, to which the witness replied that appellant had not sued him for false arrest.",4,Analysis
106,The conduct inquired about on cross-examination must be inconsistent with the trait of character to which the witness had attested.,4,Analysis
106,"The Court believes that a law requiring any permitted sign, no matter how big or small, on any land, be it public or private, in any language other than Chamorro or English to have a translation into either which ""must predominate the sign"", [has] a chilling effect on such a protected mode of expression.",4,Analysis
106,"The Court fears, however, that this procedure would not necessarily solve defendant's problem.",4,Analysis
106,"The court held that sufficient diligence had not been demonstrated, and we agree with such holding.",4,Analysis
106,The Court is not deciding whether or not the Government may constitutionally require commercial signs to be translated into English or Chamorro.,4,Analysis
106,The Court is of the opinion that he foregoing Order involves a controlling issue of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the Order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.,4,Analysis
106,"The Court notes that defendant's proper and least problematic method to obtain his appeal is by way of writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, or in this Court.",4,Analysis

106,"The court’s ruling on appellant’s objections to the charge is not before us for review, exception above the judge’s signature being required.",4,Analysis
106,The District Court sees no reason why it should make a de novo decision on matters which were not fully briefed and presented before the Superior Court of Guam.,4,Analysis
106,The efforts of an accused to induce a witness to testify falsely may be shown as indicating a consciousness of guilt.,4,Analysis

106,The evidence was undisputed that appellant consented to the search.,4,Analysis
106,The fact that appellant was under arrest when he gave the consent did not vitiate the same.,4,Analysis
106,The fact that appellant was under arrest when he made an oral statement at the scene of the accident would not alone render such statement inadmissible.,4,Analysis

106,The general trend of authority is against an interpretation of repeal by implication.,4,Analysis
106,The Government consents to be sued only as provided in the Act. It can not be easily construed in the absence of express language that the adoption of §680.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure necessarily implied a repeal of §6500.15 of the Government Code.,4,Analysis
106,The government has all the tools of any civil suit to refine the plaintiff's theory before trial.,4,Analysis

106,"The merits as to the actual rights and obligation between the buyers and sellers are not subject of this appeal; the only issue before us is whether the January 8, 1979 Order of the Superior Court purporting to enforce a settlement agreement made to the court by the parties during trial was error.",4,Analysis
106,"The notice of claim is not a pleading, neither is it a trap for the unwary.",4,Analysis

106,"The testimony as to the general reputation for virtue and chastity of the prosecutrix, offered after appellant had testified that she did not resist but in effect consented, was properly admitted.",4,Analysis
106,"The testimony of Officer Stone as to the manner in which appellant was driving the pickup upon the public highway and that he had been drinking and was “too tight” to be driving was sufficient to authorize his arrest without a warrant, under the provisions of Art. 803, V.A.P.C.",4,Analysis

106,"There is no statement of facts on a hearing, and we cannot accept the allegations in the motion as proof of such fact.",4,Analysis
106,"There was but one issue in this case, consent or not by the prosecutrix, and any circumstance that could be shown tending to show that the prosecutrix was not a virgin would be admissible as bearing on the issue of her consent in a manner consistent with the appellants’ innocence.",4,Analysis
106,"There, we said: “* * * merely because a lesser offense is included within the proof of a greater offense, a charge on the lesser",4,Analysis
106,"Therefore, appellant is in no position to complain of the search because the same or similar testimony was admitted without objection.",4,Analysis

107,The testimony complained of was not improper as forcing the appellant to give evidence against himself.,5,Conclusion
107,The trial court did not err in admitting this evidence.,5,Conclusion
107,"There being no proof of the corpus delicti and the uncorroborated confession of the appellant being insufficient as a matter of law, the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.",5,Conclusion
107,"There is no error in admitting such evidence because escape, flight and attempts to escape are always admissible as evidence of guilt.",5,Conclusion
107,There was no error in admitting the testimony.,5,Conclusion
107,These photographs were admissible to illustrate a disputed issue.,5,Conclusion
107,This case is hereby dismissed.,5,Conclusion
107,This violation authorized the arrest of the appellant and the search of his car was legal as it was incident to his arrest.,5,Conclusion
107,"This was clearly inadmissible, and the court erred in failing to respond to appellant’s motion to withdraw the same from the jury’s consideration.",5,Conclusion
107,"Thus all of the above counts are specifically authorized by Government Code §6500.20 as more than $100,000 is claimed, and these counts are within the jurisdiction of the Court.",5,Conclusion

107,We find no error in the admission of the testimony of the prosecutrix as to such outcry or report.,5,Conclusion
107,We find no merit in appellant’s contention that the court erred in admitting in evidence the four bottles containing the barbiturates and amphetamine tablets because it constituted proof of other extraneous crimes.,5,Conclusion
107,We find the allegations of the indictment sufficient to charge an offense under the statute.,5,Conclusion
107,We find the evidence sufficient to prove that appellant did offer the prosecuting witness money to engage in prostitution.,5,Conclusion
107,We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and do not deem it necessary to set out the testimony corroborating the testimony of the prosecutrix.,5,Conclusion
107,We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and overrule appellant’s contention that there was a fatal variance between the allegation and proof of embezzlement and that under the evidence appellant could not be guilty of embezzlement of the mohair but only guilty of embezzlement of the money derived from the sale thereof.,5,Conclusion
107,"We have carefully analyzed the facts before us here and have concluded that they are of such a nature that the mind is led intuitively, or by a conscious process of reasoning, toward the conviction that from the facts proven penetration may be inferred.",5,Conclusion
107,We have carefully reviewed the cases cited by appellant in support of his contention that the search was illegal and do not deem them here controlling.,5,Conclusion

107,"We have examined the charge, however, in light of the objections and find no error which, had exception been properly reserved, would warrant reversal.",5,Conclusion
107,We overrule appellant’s remaining contention that the court erred in failing to charge the jury on the law of entrapment.,5,Conclusion
107,We overrule appellant’s remaining contention that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction because his oral confession to Officer Geffert was not corroborated.,5,Conclusion
107,"We overrule appellant’s remaining contention that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction because the state failed to prove appellant possessed “dolophine”, which was a descriptive averment in the indictment.",5,Conclusion
107,We overrule the contention that in said Paragraph 4 the burden of proof was placed upon the defendant.,5,Conclusion
107,We see no error in the admission of the prosecutrix’ testimony that she was a widow.,5,Conclusion

107,"While there appears to be a conflict in consistency between the Claims Act and the Civil Procedure Code regarding jury trial, it does not appear so repugnant an inconsistency that the two provisions cannot stand together.",5,Conclusion
