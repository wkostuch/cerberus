The second objection was made to the introduction of the knife into the evidence.,2,Issue
"The offense is driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 5 days in jail and a fine of $150.",2,Issue
"The conviction is for negligent homicide in the first degree; the punishment, nine months in jail.",2,Issue
Appellant contends that the court erred in overruling his exception to the second count of the indictment on the ground it did not allege the offense of negligent homicide in the second degree.,2,Issue
"Subsequent to this ruling by the court and after the introduction of further testimony, appellant’s counsel moved for a mistrial.",2,Issue
"By motion to quash, appellants challenged the sufficiency of the judgment nisi to support the final judgment forfeiting the bond, for the reason that it fails to conform to Art. 425, V.A.C.C.P.",2,Issue
Appellant filed no objections to the court’s charge but on appeal urges as fundamental error the court’s failure to limit the jury’s consideration of such testimony in the charge.,2,Issue
"Appellant makes two contentions, by informal bills of exception.",2,Issue

"The offense is burglary, with two prior felony convictions alleged for enhancement; the punishment, life.",2,Issue
"The offense is burglary; the punishment, five years.",2,Issue
"The record sustains appellants’ contention that there was no service of citation upon either of them, for which reason the default judgment making final the forfeiture of the appearance bond upon which they are sureties is without support.",2,Issue
Appellant’s remaining contention is that there was no evidence that the offense charged was committed in Texas.,2,Issue

"The conviction is for negligent homicide in the second degree; the punishment, one year in jail.",2,Issue
He further contends that the issue of his guilt was submitted to the jury upon two separate factual theories; that the jury returned a general verdict of guilty; and that there was no way of ascertaining upon which one of the two theories the jury found him guilty.,2,Issue
And further contends that if he did convert said automobile the evidence fails to show that it occurred in El Paso County.,2,Issue
Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to show a conversion of the automobile because he never at any time asserted claim to it which was adverse to the owner.,2,Issue
The sole contention presented on appeal is that the court erred in failing to charge on the law of circumstantial evidence.,2,Issue
"In the same bill of exception, appellant raised another proposition or contention, maintaining that the trial court materially erred in charging the jury upon the law of principals.",2,Issue

"Murder is the offense; the punishment, ninety-nine years in the penitentiary.",2,Issue
It is contended that the arrest of appellant was unlawful and the evidence relating thereto and to the recovery of the fruits of the robbery was improperly admitted.,2,Issue
Appellant contends that the offering in evidence of the application for the suspended sentence created a fact issue for the jury and that it made it incumbent upon the trial court to instruct upon and to present to the jury for its determination the issue of a suspended sentence.,2,Issue
The only major conflict in the evidence concerns whether the killing was the result of an accident or whether it was a malicious murder.,2,Issue
Appellant cites a number of cases where pictures were found to be inflammatory and not admissible under the facts.,2,Issue
"First, he complains of and submits as error the action of the trial court in failing to instruct the jury relative to the application of the suspended sentence law.",2,Issue
Appellant’s remaining contention is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.,2,Issue

"It would do violence to the intent of the legislature and to the holdings mentioned to hold that the pleading of the defendant would suffice as proof that he had never been convicted of a felony, thereby relieving him of the necessity of testifying as a witness or of offering the evidence of other witnesses who could be cross-examined.",3,Rule/Law/Holding

"The allegation was insufficient to charge that appellant was in performance of an unlawful act. Appellant’s exception to the second count of the indictment should have been, by the court, sustained.",4,Analysis
The legality of the act would be made to depend upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time.,4,Analysis
The failure of the proof introduced to support the material allegations in the information calls for a reversal.,4,Analysis
The judgment rendered in effect upheld appellant’s contention that he was entitled to acquittal if not found guilty of aggravated assault.,4,Analysis

The proceedings appear to be otherwise regular and we find no error.,4,Analysis

We first overrule appellant’s contention that the court erred in permitting the state to prove the two prior alleged convictions by offering in evidence the authenticated prison records and the expert opinion evidence of Officer Ballew as to his comparison of fingerprints.,4,Analysis
The facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant the jury’s conclusion that the appellant fradulently converted the car to his own use with the intent to deprive the owner of the value thereof in El Paso County.,4,Analysis

One cannot be both a bailee and a thief at the same time.,4,Analysis
It is insisted that this conviction cannot stand because it rests on a bailment made when the appellant was under 21 years of age.,4,Analysis
"If he became a thief, then the bailment ceased, and Hertz was entitled to no rent money on the car.",4,Analysis
"A thief would not be a bailee, and he would owe no rent.",4,Analysis
