"The offense is driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 5 days in jail and a fine of $150.",2,Issue
"The conviction is for negligent homicide in the first degree; the punishment, nine months in jail.",2,Issue

"By motion to quash, appellants challenged the sufficiency of the judgment nisi to support the final judgment forfeiting the bond, for the reason that it fails to conform to Art. 425, V.A.C.C.P.",2,Issue
Appellant filed no objections to the court’s charge but on appeal urges as fundamental error the court’s failure to limit the jury’s consideration of such testimony in the charge.,2,Issue
"Appellant makes two contentions, by informal bills of exception.",2,Issue

"The offense is burglary; the punishment, five years.",2,Issue
"The record sustains appellants’ contention that there was no service of citation upon either of them, for which reason the default judgment making final the forfeiture of the appearance bond upon which they are sureties is without support.",2,Issue

"The offense is the unlawful possession of beer in a wet area for the purpose of sale without a license; the punishment, 60 days in jail and a fine of $500.",2,Issue
"The offense is aggravated assault, with punishment assessed at thirty days in jail.",2,Issue

And further contends that if he did convert said automobile the evidence fails to show that it occurred in El Paso County.,2,Issue
Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to show a conversion of the automobile because he never at any time asserted claim to it which was adverse to the owner.,2,Issue
The sole contention presented on appeal is that the court erred in failing to charge on the law of circumstantial evidence.,2,Issue
"In the same bill of exception, appellant raised another proposition or contention, maintaining that the trial court materially erred in charging the jury upon the law of principals.",2,Issue
"The offense is burglary, with two prior convictions for felonies less than capital alleged for enhancement; the punishment, life imprisonment under Art. 63, V.A.C.C.P.",2,Issue

"Murder is the offense; the punishment, ninety-nine years in the penitentiary.",2,Issue
It is contended that the arrest of appellant was unlawful and the evidence relating thereto and to the recovery of the fruits of the robbery was improperly admitted.,2,Issue
Appellant contends that the offering in evidence of the application for the suspended sentence created a fact issue for the jury and that it made it incumbent upon the trial court to instruct upon and to present to the jury for its determination the issue of a suspended sentence.,2,Issue
The only major conflict in the evidence concerns whether the killing was the result of an accident or whether it was a malicious murder.,2,Issue
Appellant cites a number of cases where pictures were found to be inflammatory and not admissible under the facts.,2,Issue
"First, he complains of and submits as error the action of the trial court in failing to instruct the jury relative to the application of the suspended sentence law.",2,Issue
Appellant’s remaining contention is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.,2,Issue

"R. 582, 223 S.W. 2d 625, we said: “We think the condition evidenced by the photographs was useful to the jury in not only determining an intent to kill, but also the malice, if any was shown; and photographs have always been held admissable provided they serve to illustrate any necessary point in the cause.”",3,Rule/Law/Holding

"It would do violence to the intent of the legislature and to the holdings mentioned to hold that the pleading of the defendant would suffice as proof that he had never been convicted of a felony, thereby relieving him of the necessity of testifying as a witness or of offering the evidence of other witnesses who could be cross-examined.",3,Rule/Law/Holding

We are unable to conclude that the pictures were not admissible as shedding light upon those issues.”,4,Analysis
"The allegation was insufficient to charge that appellant was in performance of an unlawful act. Appellant’s exception to the second count of the indictment should have been, by the court, sustained.",4,Analysis
The legality of the act would be made to depend upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time.,4,Analysis
The failure of the proof introduced to support the material allegations in the information calls for a reversal.,4,Analysis
The judgment rendered in effect upheld appellant’s contention that he was entitled to acquittal if not found guilty of aggravated assault.,4,Analysis
"No reason exists why the rule should not apply to a sodomy case such as the one before us where the victim of the lust is a young boy, 13 years of age, when the acts are committed.",4,Analysis

The proceedings appear to be otherwise regular and we find no error.,4,Analysis
"We think the evidence, which appellant deemed “highly prejudicial,” was made harmless to him (appellant) by the able trial judge’s instruction to the jury to disregard it and that any harm which might have resulted to the appellant was thereby cured.",4,Analysis
"This being a misdemeanor case where the jurors could separate, the allegation was not an allegation of jury misconduct upon which the trial judge was required to hear evidence.",4,Analysis
"While the asking of the leading question might well be improper, the response given to the question asked was not hearsay.",4,Analysis
"But appellant made no objection after the question was answered, and there is no showing as to why he chose to delay making his objection.",4,Analysis
The objection to the court’s charge and the refusal of a requested charge show no error.,4,Analysis
Such requisition is sufficient to authorize the issuance of the executive warrant by the governor of this state.,4,Analysis
The question of jury separation sought to be raised in the statement of facts does not reflect error.,4,Analysis
"But appellant not having objected until the question was answered, his failure to declare a mistrial because of the question and answer will not authorize a reversal.",4,Analysis
There was sufficient evidence also to sustain the jury’s finding that appellant was intoxicated.,4,Analysis
We find the evidence sufficient to support the jury’s verdict.,4,Analysis
Appellant’s contentions are without merit.,4,Analysis
The driving of an automobile across a double stripe and highway marker may or may not be an unlawful act.,4,Analysis
The prima facie evidence rule arising from the possession of a certain quantity of beer in a dry area has no application in a wet area case.,4,Analysis

"Remarks of counsel for the state during the introduction of evidence complained of should not have been made, but in view of the evidence are not deemed of such prejudicial nature as to warrant reversal.",4,Analysis
"If under the facts such testimony was not admissible as bearing upon the issue of self defense, appellant is in no position to complain because like evidence was offered without objection.",4,Analysis
"We find no error in the admission of evidence to the effect that the injured party had an incapacity in his left arm, and that appellant’s physical condition was good.",4,Analysis
He also testified that he fired a third shot which was also accidental.,4,Analysis
"Officer Tackitt testified without objection to these facts, hence appellant is in no position to rely upon his objection to Officer Donahoe’s testimony to the same facts.",4,Analysis

The court’s instruction was sufficient to cure any error therein.,4,Analysis
"Under the record, we are unable to say that appellant was injured by the court’s failure to limit the jury’s consideration of the impeachment testimony and overrule the contention that such omission in the charge constituted fundamental error requiring a reversal of the conviction.",4,Analysis
We first overrule appellant’s contention that the court erred in permitting the state to prove the two prior alleged convictions by offering in evidence the authenticated prison records and the expert opinion evidence of Officer Ballew as to his comparison of fingerprints.,4,Analysis
The facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant the jury’s conclusion that the appellant fradulently converted the car to his own use with the intent to deprive the owner of the value thereof in El Paso County.,4,Analysis
The allegation that appellant was in performance of the act of driving an automobile “across a double stripe and highway marker” was not an allegation that he was in the performance of an unlawful act.,4,Analysis

"Finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.",4,Analysis
The fact that the appellant was 18 years of age when he signed the rental agreement for the car as he testified would not prevent him from committing felony theft by bailee and being prosecuted and convicted for such offense.,4,Analysis
The evidence would appear to be admissible.,4,Analysis
We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict finding appellant guilty of murder with malice and assessing his punishment at 99 years in the penitentiary.,4,Analysis
"Had the Diner’s Club only paid Hertz for six days’ rental— that is, up until the time (January 20) that Hertz filed the complaint — then a different question would be presented.",4,Analysis
He either remains a bailee or he becomes a thief.,4,Analysis
One cannot be both a bailee and a thief at the same time.,4,Analysis
It is insisted that this conviction cannot stand because it rests on a bailment made when the appellant was under 21 years of age.,4,Analysis
"If he became a thief, then the bailment ceased, and Hertz was entitled to no rent money on the car.",4,Analysis
"A thief would not be a bailee, and he would owe no rent.",4,Analysis
"If the appellant converted the car, he was guilty of theft by bailee, as charged.",4,Analysis
"As these provisions have been construed by the highest courts of this state as well as by the Supreme Court of the United States, a state law is not repugnant to either constitutional provision so long as unequal treatment of persons is based upon a reasonable and substantial classification of persons.",4,Analysis
